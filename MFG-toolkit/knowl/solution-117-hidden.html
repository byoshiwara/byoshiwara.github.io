<li>
<p>The distributive law applies to multiplying a sum or difference, not a product. In the first equation, \(5 \cdot 3^x\) is a product, so the distributive law does not apply.  (We can, however, simplfy that expression with the associative law:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2(5 \cdot 3^x) = (2\cdot 5)\cdot 3^x = 10 \cdot 3^x
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The second equation is a correct application of the distributive law. You can check that the first equation is false and the second equation is true by substituting \(x=1\text{.}\)</p>

<p>The distributive law applies only to multiplying a sum or product, not to other operations, such as taking logs.  You can check that the first equation is false by substituting \(x=10\text{.}\)</p>
