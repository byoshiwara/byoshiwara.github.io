<p>The city reservoir was completely emptied for repairs, and is now being refilled. Water flows in through the intake pipe at a steady rate that can fill the reservoir in 120 days. However, water is also being drained from the reservoir as it is used by the city, so that it actually takes 150 days to fill. After the reservoir is filled, the water supply is turned off, but the city continues to use water at the same rate. How long will it take to drain the reservoir dry?</p>
