<div class="introduction">
<p>In this application, the work being done is the water flowing into (or out of) the reservoir, so the work rate is the flow rate of water through the pipes.</p>
<p>The city reservoir was completely emptied for repairs, and is now being refilled. Water flows in through the intake pipe at a steady rate that can fill the reservoir in 120 days. However, water is also being drained from the reservoir as it is used by the city, so that it actually takes 150 days to fill. After the reservoir is filled, the water supply is turned off, but the city continues to use water at the same rate. How long will it take to drain the reservoir dry?</p>
</div>
<article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">a.</span></h6>
<p>Let \(d\) stand for the number of days for the outflow pipe to drain the full reservoir.</p>
<p>Fraction of the reservoir that is drained in one day: <span class="fillin" role="img" aria-label="20-character blank" style="width: 9.090909090909092em;"></span></p>
<p>This is the rate at which water leaves the reservoir.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">b.</span></h6>
<p>Now imagine that the intake pipe is open, but the outflow pipe is closed.</p>
<p>Fraction of the reservoir that is filled in one day: <span class="fillin" role="img" aria-label="20-character blank" style="width: 9.090909090909092em;"></span></p>
<p>This is the rate at which water enters the reservoir.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">c.</span></h6>
<p>Consider the time period described in the problem when both pipes are open. Fill in the table.</p>
