<div class="para">The number <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> is essential for many advanced topics, and it is often called the <dfn class="terminology">natural base</dfn>. It may seem strange to use an irrational number as the base for exponential functions, but just as the irrational number <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> arises naturally in geometry, so does <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> arise in calculus and its applications. At the end of this section weâ€™ll look at a specific case of how base <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> occurs, and how its use is connected to the ideas and techniques of calculus.</div>
