<div class="para">We have looked at logarithms with various bases, and in particular we studied the common or base 10 logarithms, which often appear in applications. There is another base for logarithms and exponential functions that is used in scientific applications. This base is an irrational number called <span class="process-math">\(e\text{,}\)</span> where</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\blert{e \approx 2.71828182845}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The number <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> is essential for many advanced topics, and it is often called the <dfn class="terminology">natural base</dfn>. It may seem strange to use an irrational number as the base for exponential functions, but just as the irrational number <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> arises naturally in geometry, so does <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> arise in calculus and its applications.</div>
