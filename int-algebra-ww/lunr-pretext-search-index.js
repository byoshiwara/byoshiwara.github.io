  "body": " Intermediate Algebra is a textbook for students who have some acquaintance with the basic notions of variables and equations, negative numbers, and graphs, although we provide a \"Toolkit\" to help the reader refresh any skills that may have gotten a little rusty. In this book we journey farther into the subject, to explore a greater variety of topics including graphs and modeling, curve-fitting, variation, exponentials and logarithms, and the conic sections. We use technology to handle data and give some instructions for using a graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility.  We discuss functions and their applications, but not in the detail expected of a precalculus course; our intended audience includes students preparing for the many fields that may not use calculus but nonetheless require facility with quantitative reasoning. We aim to develop that facility in the context of modeling and problem solving.   Each section of the text includes Examples followed by a similar Practice Exercise that students can try for themselves in WeBWorK.  There are also \"QuickCheck\" exercises, usually multiple choice or fill in the blanks, for students to check their understanding of the concepts presented.  Homework problems come in three groups: a short Skills Warm Up that reviews prerequisite skills for the section, then Skills Practice with new skills, and finally Applications.  We have included a variety of applied problems that we hope students (and their teachers) will find interesting.  In addition, each Chapter begins with an Investigation that can be used as a group project or as a guided in-class activity.  Chapter Reviews include a Glossary and a Summary of key concepts as well as Review Problems. There is an Activity booklet available that provides an interactive lesson for each section of the text. The Activities can be completed by students in groups or with guidance from the instructor; or they can be used as support for a lecture format.  Katherine Yoshiwara  Atascadero, CA 2020  "

  "title": "Creating a Linear Model",
  "body": "Creating a Linear Model linear model   To help them understand phenomena that affect our planet, scientists study the connections between relevant variables, such as sea level. In the next investigation we consider a simpler example and look at some ways to connect the variables involved in a career choice.  Sales on Commission  Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment. He will be paid $1000 per month plus a 6% commission on his sales. The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about $8000 worth of equipment per month. To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations.  Based on the sales manager's estimate, what monthly income can Delbert expect from this job? What annual salary would that provide?  What would Delbert's monthly salary be if he sold only $5000 of equipment per month? What would his salary be if he sold $10,000 worth per month? Compute the monthly incomes for each sales totals shown in the table.    Sales  Income                           Plot your data points on a graph, using sales, , on the horizontal axis and income, , on the vertical axis, as shown in the figure. Connect the data points to show Delbert's monthly income for all possible monthly sales totals.  graph  Add two new data points to the table by reading values from your graph.  Write an algebraic expression for Delbert's monthly income, , in terms of his monthly sales, . Use the description in the problem to help you:  He will be paid: $1000 plus a 6% commission on his sales.  Income  Test your formula from part (5) to see if it gives the same results as those you recorded in the table.  Use your formula to find out what monthly sales total Delbert would need in order to have a monthly income of $2500.  Each increase of $1000 in monthly sales increases Delbert's monthly income by .  Summarize the results of your work: In your own words, describe the relationship between Delbert's monthly sales and his monthly income. Include in your discussion a description of your graph.    Tables, Graphs, and Equations  In the Investigation you studied the connection between the variables Sales and Income for a part-time job. You created a mathematical model for that situation.  Mathematical Model  A mathematical model mathematical model model is a simplified description of reality that uses mathematics to help us understand a system or process.  We can use a model to analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change. The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between the variables involved.  QuickCheck 1  Starting from a description in words, we can represent the relationship by: a table of values  a graph, or by  an algebraic equation  Each of these mathematical tools is useful in a different way.  A table of values table of values lists specific data points with precise numerical values.  A graph graph is a visual display of the data. It is easier to spot trends and describe the overall behavior of the variables from a graph.  An algebraic equation algebraic equation equation algebraic is a compact summary of the model. It can be used to analyze the model and to make predictions.   Look back at the Investigation to see how each of these modeling tools featured in your work.  QuickCheck 2  In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools and how each contributes to the model.  In May 2005, the city of Lyons, France, started a bicycle rental program. Over 3,000 bicycles are available at 350 computerized stations around the city. Each of the 52,000 subscribers pays an annual 5 euro fee (about $7.20) and gets a PIN to access the bicycles. The bicycles rent for 1 euro per hour and can be returned to any station.  Your community decides to set up a similar program, charging a $5 subscription fee and $3 an hour for rental. (A fraction of an hour is charged as the corresponding fraction of $3).   Make a table of values showing the cost, , of renting a bike for various lengths of time, .  Plot the points on a graph. Draw a curve through the data points.  Write an equation for in terms of .    There is an initial fee of $5, and a rental fee of $3 per hour. To find the cost, we multiply the rental time by $3 per hour, and add the result to the $5 subscription fee. For example, the cost of a one-hour bike ride is A one-hour bike ride costs $8.  We calculate the cost for the other values of and record the results in a table as shown below.     Length of rental (hours)  Cost of rental (dollars)                         Each pair of values represents a point on the graph. The first value gives the horizontal coordinate of the point, and the second value gives the vertical coordinate.  The points lie on a straight line, as shown in the figure. The line extends infinitely in only one direction, because negative values of do not make sense here.  graph  To write an equation, we let represent the cost of the rental, and we use for the number of hours:     For more help on plotting points, see Section 1.1.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1   Equations for Linear Models  The equation we wrote in Example 1.1.4 , , is an example of a linear model , which describes a variable that increases or decreases at a constant rate. The cost of renting a bicycle increased at a constant rate of $3 every hour.  Linear Model linear model  A linear model linear model describes a variable that increases or decreases at a constant rate. It has the form   QuickCheck 3  For more help on writing a linear model, see Section 1.1.1 of the Toolkit.  The connections between an equation and its graph can give us useful information about a model. In the next Example we see how to use this idea.   Use the equation you found in to answer the following questions. Then show how to find the answers by using the graph.   How much will it cost to rent a bicycle for 6 hours?  How long can you bicycle for $18.50?    We substitute into the equation to find A 6-hour bike ride will cost $23. The point on the graph in the figure represents the cost of a 6-hour bike ride. The value on the -axis at the same height as point is 23, so a 6-hour bike ride costs $23.   We substitute into the equation and solve for .  For $18.50 you can bicycle for hours. The point on the graph represents an $18.50 bike ride. The value on the -axis below point is 4.5, so $18.50 will buy a 4.5 hour bike ride.  line though points    For more help on solving linear equations, see Section 1.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 2  cost of bike rental   In , note the different algebraic techniques we used in parts (a) and (b):   In part (a) we were given a value of and we evaluated the expression  to find .  In part (b) we were given a value of and we solved the equation  to find .   QuickCheck 4  In the examples above, the graph is increasing increasing graph graph increasing as increases. In the next Example we consider a decreasing graph decreasing graph decreasing graph decreasing function graph decreasing graph decreasing decreasing function .  Leon's camper has a 20-gallon gas tank, and he gets 12 miles to the gallon. (Note that getting 12 miles to the gallon is the same as using gallon of gas per mile.)   Write an equation for the amount of gasoline, , left in Leon's tank after he has driven for miles.  Make a table of values for the equation.  Graph the equation.  If Leon has less than 5 gallons of gas left, how many miles has he driven since his last fill-up? Illustrate on the graph.    We use the form for a linear model, However, in this problem, instead of variables and , we use and . Leon's fuel tank started with 20 gallons, and the amount of gasoline is decreasing at a rate of gallon for every mile that he drives. Thus,  Every time Leon drives 12 miles, he uses another gallon of gasoline. So, to make the calculations easier, we choose values that are divisible by 12.     (miles)       (gallons)       We scale the values of along the horizontal axis, and the values of along the vertical axis. Then we plot the points from the table and connect with a line, as shown in the figure below.  If Leon has less than 5 gallons of gasoline left, then , as shown on the -axis. Using our model from part (a), we solve the inequality.  Leon has driven at least 180 miles. The solution is shown on the graph below.   gas mileage   For more help on solving linear inequalities, see Section 1.1.4 of the Toolkit.  In part (d) of the previous Example we used an inequality inequality to answer the question. We use inequalities to model English phrases such as \"less than,\" \"more than,\" \"at least,\" and \"at most.\"  Practice 3  grid   line     Problem Set 1.1  Warm Up  Solve the equation.

  "body": "Graphs and Equations  Equations and Solutions  In the last section we studied some linear models, and in particular we looked at graphs and equations that described those models. In this section we review some techniques and terminology related to equations, inequalities, and their graphs.  Solution  A solution solution to an equation in one variable of an equation is a value of the variable that makes the equation true.  For example, is a solution of the equation because .  QuickCheck 1  For more help on checking for a solution, see Section 1.2.1 of the Toolkit.  A linear equation has no powers of the variable other than 1. It has at most one solution. We find the solution by transforming the equation into a simpler equivalent equation whose solution is obvious.  Solve the equation  We begin by simplifying each side of the equation.  The solution is . You can check that substituting into the original equation produces a true statement.  For more help on solving linear equations, see Section 1.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1   Linear Inequalities linear inequality inequality linear  Although a linear equation can have at most one solution, a linear inequality can have many solutions. For example, complete the table of values for the expression :                      Now use your table to list at least three solutions of the inequality .  Use algebra to solve the inequality .  We begin by isolating the term containing the variable, just as we do when solving a linear equation. We subtract 5 from both sides to obtain Then we divide both sides by to find Any value of greater than is a solution of the inequality. We write the solutions as . Because we cannot list all of these solutions, we often illustrate them as a graph on a number line , as shown below.  number line for inequality   In the Example above, we used the following rule for solving linear inequalities.  Solving a Linear Inequality linear inequality inequality linear  If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality.   Other than the rule stated in the box above, the rules for solving a linear inequality are the same as the rules for solving a linear equation.  For more help on solving linear inequalities, see Section 1.1.4 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2  Practice 2  number line for inequality    Equations in Two Variables equation in two variables  An equation in two variables , such as has many solutions. Each solution solution to an equation in two variables consists of an ordered pair of values, one for and one for , that together satisfy the equation (make the equation true.)  QuickCheck 3   Is a solution of the equation ?  Is a solution of the equation ?    The ordered pair is a solution of the equation above, because it satifies the equation.  The ordered pair is not a solution, because it does not satify the equation.   For more help on finding solutions of an equation in two variables, see Section 1.2.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3  Because an equation in two variables may have many solutions, we can use a graph to visualize those solutions.  Graph graph  The graph graph of an equation in two variables is just a picture of all its solutions.   You might think it would be difficult to find all the solutions of an equation, but for a linear equation , we can at least illustrate the solutions: all the solutions lie on a straight line. (Later on we can prove that this is true.)  QuickCheck 4  The figure shows a graph of the equation . Which of the following equations are true?     line and points   The point lies on the graph, so , is a solution of the equation. Thus, , or is a true statement.  The point does not lie on the graph, so , does not satisfy the equation, and is a not true.  The point does lie on the graph, so , does satisfy the equation, and is a true statement.  Practice 4 grid grid   Graphical Solution of Equations and Inequalities equation graphical solution  Here is a clever way to solve an equation in one variable by using a graph. Suppose we would like to solve the equation . We start by looking at the graph of .  Use the graph of to solve the equation   Compare the two equations in the problem. In the equation we want to solve, has been replaced by . We begin by locating the point on the graph for which .  Next we find the -coordinate of point by drawing an imaginary line from straight down to the -axis. The -coordinate of is .   function graph  Thus, is the point , and when . The solution we seek is .  You can verify the solution algebraically by substituting into the equation:  Does ?    The relationship between an equation and its graph is an important one. For the previous example, make sure you understand that the following three statements are equivalent.   The point lies on the graph of .  The ordered pair is a solution of the equation .  is a solution of the equation .   Practice 5 line  We can also use graphs to solve inequalities. Consider the inequality To solve this inequality means to find all values of that make the expression greater than or equal to 150. We could begin by trying some values of . Here is a table obtained by evaluating .                      From the table, we see that values of less than or equal to 8 are solutions of the inequality, but we have not checked all possible -values. We can get a more complete picture from a graph.  Use the graph of the equation to solve the inequality   We look for points on the graph with -coordinates greater than or equal to 150. These points are shown in color. Which -values produced these points?  We can read the -coordinates by dropping straight down to the -axis, as shown by the arows. For example, the -value corresponding to is . For larger values of , we must choose -values less than 9. Thus, all values of less than or equal to 9 are solutions, as shown on the -axis.  linear inequality  We write the solutions as .   Practice 6 line   Using a Graphing Utility  We can use a graphing utility to graph equations if they are written in the form . First, let's review how to solve an equation for in terms of .  Solve the equation for in terms of .  To begin, we isolate the -term by subtracting from both sides of the equation. Note that the equation now has the form of the linear models we saw in Section 1.1 .  Practice 7  Now we are ready to graph an equation with technology. For most graphing utilities, we follow three steps.  To Graph an Equation   Enter the equation you wish to graph.  Select a graphing window.  Graph.   Choosing a graphing window corresponds to drawing the - and -axes and marking a scale on each axis when we graph by hand. The standard graphing window displays values from to on both axes. We can start with this window and then adjust it if necessary.  Use a graphing utility to graph the equation .  First, we solve the equation for in terms of .  Now enter after , and choose the standard graphing window. The graph is shown at right.  Graphing calculator line   Don't forget to erase your graph when you are done.  Practice 8  Graph for part (b):  graph   We can use the TRACE feature to find the coordinates of points on a graph.  Use a graph to find a solution to the equation with -coordinate .  First we graph the equation in the window   Xmin   Xmax   Ymin   Ymax   GC trace  We press TRACE , and a \"bug\" begins flashing on the display. The coordinates of the bug appear at the bottom of the display, as shown in the figure. We use the left and right arrows to move the bug along the graph. You can check that the coordinates of the point do satisfy the equation .   Practice 9  Graph for part (a):  GC line     Problem Set 1.2  Warm Up  For Problems 1 2, decide whether the ordered pairs are solutions of the equation whose graph is shown.       h=t+7\/2   no  yes  no  no        m=2+ square of p-4    For Problems 3 6, decide whether the ordered pairs are solutions of the given equation.        yes  no  no  yes               no  no  yes  yes         For Problems 7 8, state the interval that each grid line represents on the horizontal and vertical axes.   grid horizontal: 0.25; vertical: 4   grid     What interval does each grid line represent on the horizontal axis?

Make a table of values showing several choices for and .  Plot the points from your table, and graph the equation.    Each television ad costs $150, so ads will cost $ . Similarly, radio ads will cost $ . The manager has $3000 to spend, so the sum of the costs must be $3000. Thus,  We choose some values of , and solve the equation for the corresponding value of . For example, if then If the manager buys 10 television ads, she can also buy 30 radio ads. You can verify the other entries in the table.                We plot the points from the table.

  "body": "Slope slope   The introduction to Chapter 1 discussed the rise in sea level over the last few decades. One of the contributing factors to this rise is the melting of Earth's glaciers.  Glaciers around the world are retreating at accelerating rates, and many lower-latitude mountain glaciers may soon disappear entirely. The meltwater from these smaller glaciers contributed as much as 40% to the total rise in sea level over the 1990s.  By measuring the change in ice and snow height at fixed points and multiplying by the surface area surface area of the glacier, scientists calculate the total volume volume of water lost from land-based glaciers. Dividing this volume by the surface area of the world's oceans gives the resulting change in sea level.  The graphs below show the change in thickness of the land-based glaciers overthe past 5 years, and the rise in sea level attributed to their melting. In this section we consider how to measure a rate of change.  graphs of change in glacier thickness and resulting rise in sea level   Rate of Change rate of change  The equation we use to describe a linear model, , gives the starting value of the variable and the rate at which changes. Now we will look more closely at rates and how they appear on the graph of the model. First, let's review the notion of a ratio used as a rate. You are already familiar with several types of rates.  Rate rate  A rate is a type of ratio that compares two quantities with different units.   QuickCheck 1  In the examples below, notice that each rate has units of the form , which we read as \"something per something else.\"  Caryn bought 7 used paperback novels for a total of $2.45. Use a ratio to calculate the price per book.   The novels were priced at a rate of $0.35 per book.  For more help on using ratios and rates, see Section 1.4.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1  The rate you calculated in Practice 1, Delbert's average speed, actually compares the change in two variables, his distance from his starting point, and the time elapsed. This type of rate appears often in linear models.  Rate of Change  A rate of change rate of change rate of change slope is a special kind of ratio that compares the change in two quantities or variables.  In the next Example we calculate speed as a rate of change, and we introduce a new notation, , to help with the calculation.  Gregor is driving across Montana. At 1 pm his trip odometer reads 189 miles, and at 4 pm it reads 360 miles. Calculate Gregor's average speed as a rate of change.  We have two variables: time, , and distance, , and the following data points:          Gregor's speed is the ratio of the distance he traveled to the time it took. The distance he traveled is the change in his odometer reading (from 189 miles to 360 miles), and the time it took is the change in the clock reading (from 1 pm to 4 pm).The units of this ratio are miles per hour.  In mathematics, we use the symbol Delta ( ) (delta) for change in change in Delta ( ) . Thus Gregor's average speed is the ratio , so   QuickCheck 2  Practice 2   How do we see the rate of change on a graph? Let's consider the example above. The graph shows Gregor's distance, , at time . We plot the two data points, and , and draw a straight line joining them. We can illustrate and by vertical and horizontal line segments, as shown on the graph.  delta d and delta t on line  The rate of change of distance with respect to time, or speed, is the ratio of to . It measures how much changes for each unit increase in , or how far Gregor travels in each hour. This quantity, the ratio , is the slope of the line .  For more help calculating slope from a graph, see Section 1.4.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 3   Review of Slope slope  You may have encountered the notion of slope in previous courses. Let us see how slope is related to rate of change.  Slope slope  The slope of a line is a rate of change that measures the steepness of the line.   The slope tells us how much the -coordinate changes for each unit of increase in the -coordinate, as we move from one point to another along the line.  QuickCheck 4  Using the notation for \"change in,\" we define slope as follows.  Slope of a Line slope slope of a line   or, in symbols   In the definition of slope,   How does slope measure the steepness of a line? Study the three examples below and notice how changes for each 1 unit increase in .    line A  increases by 2 units    line B  increases by units    line C  decreases by 2 units    From these examples, we can make the following observations:  Slope and Steepness slope   For positive slopes, the larger the value of , the more the -value increases for each unit increase in , and the more we climb up as our location changes from left to right. (So graph A is steeper than graph B.) slope positive  If decreases as we move from left to right, then is negative when is positive, so their ratio (the slope) is negative. (See graph C.) slope positive     Compute the slope of the line.  Illustrate the slope on the graph by drawing a vertical segment of length and a horizontal segment of length .  If , what is the length of the vertical segment?   line with different scales on axes    The points and lie on the graph. As we move from the first point to the second point, increases by 20 units, so , and increases by 500 units, so . Thus   The segments are shown in the graph below.  line with different scales on axes   The slope is 25, which means that increases 25 units for each 1-unit increase in . So, if , then .   For more examples of calculating slope, see Section 1.4.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3 negative slope line with different scales on axes Graph for part (b):  negative slope line with different scales on axes   Interpreting Slope as a Rate  By putting together all of our discussion so far, we can now see that the slope of a line measures the rate of change of with respect to .  The graph shows the altitude, (in feet), of a skier minutes after getting on a ski lift.    Choose two points on the graph and compute the slope, including units.  Explain what the slope measures in this problem.  Write a linear model for in terms of .   altitude vs time   We choose the points and , as shown on the graph. Then  The slope gives the rate of change of altitude with respect to time. The skier rises at a rate of 150 feet per minute.  A linear model has the form From the graph, we see that at the skier's altitude was , and we calculated the rate of change of altitude as 150 feet per minute. Substituting these values into the formula, we find   For more help interpretine slope, see Section 1.4.3 of the Toolkit.  Slope as a Rate of Change slope rate of change   The slope of a line measures the rate of change of with respect to .  The units of and can help us interpret the slope as a rate.    Practice 4 linear graph of garbage deposited   Lines Have Constant Slope  You have probably already noticed the following important fact about lines.  Lines Have Constant Slope  The slope of a line is constant: no matter which two points you pick to compute the slope, you will always get the same value.   For the line shown in the figure, try computing the slope using the points and , and then using the points and . In each case, you should find that the slope is .  Here is another way to look at slopes. If we start at any point on the line shown and move 9 units to the right, what value of will bring us back to the line? We can use the slope formula with .   line   You can use the graph to check this result for yourself; try starting at the point .  The fact that lines have constant slope has two important consequences. First because is constant for a given line, we can use the formula to find when we know , or to find when we know .  QuickCheck 5  A wheelchair ramp can have a slope of no more than 24%, or 0.24. What horizontal distance is needed if the ramp must climb an elevation of 4 feet?   We first draw a sketch of the wheelchair ramp and label and . We are given that feet, and we are looking for . We substitute the known values into the slope formula, and solve for .  ramp  The wheelchair ramp must have a horizontal length of feet, or 16 feet 8 inches.   Practice 5  Here is a second consequence of the fact that lines have constant slope: We can tell whether a collection of data points lies on a straight line by computing slopes. If the slopes between pairs of data points are all the same, the points lie on a straight line.  QuickCheck 6  Could this table represent a linear equation? Explain why or why not.                  We compute the slope between each consecutive pair of points. In each case Because the slope is the same for all pairs of points, the table could be linear.   Practice 6  To summarize, here are two ways that we can use the slope to study a model.  Two Uses for Slope   If we know the slope of a line, we can use the formula to find when we know , or to find when we know .  To test whether a collection of data points lies on a straight line, we can compute slopes. If the slopes between all pairs of data points are the same, the points lie on a straight line.

Geologists calculate the speed of seismic waves by plotting the travel times for waves to reach seismometers at known distances from the epicenter. The speed of the wave can help them determine the nature of the material it passes through. The graph shows a travel time graph for P-waves from a shallow earthquake.  graph   Why do you think the graph is plotted with distance as the independent variable?

In 1952, much of the water of the Niagara River was diverted for hydroelectric power, but until that time erosion caused the Falls to recede upstream by 3 feet per year.  How far did the Falls recede from 1682 to 1952?  The Falls were formed about 12,000 years ago during the end of the last ice age. How far downstream from their current position were they then? (Give your answer in miles.)    Naismith’s Rule is used by runners and walkers to estimate journey times in hilly terrain. In 1892 Naismith wrote in the Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal that a person “in fair condition should allow for easy expeditions an hour for every three miles on the map, with an additional hour for every 2000 feet of ascent.” (Source: Scarf, 1998.)  According to Naismith, 1 unit of ascent requires the same travel time as how many units of horizontall travel? (This is called Naismith’s number.) Round your answer to one decimal place.  A walk in the Brecon Beacons in Wales covers 3.75 kilometers horizontally and climbs 582 meters. What is the equivalent flat distance?

Year  Sea level   1992    2002    What was the total change in sea level from land-based glaciers over the time period from 1960 to 2003?  Calculate the average rate of change of sea level from land-based glaciers from 1960 to 2003.  From 1960 to 2003, the land-based glaciers decreased in thickness by about 8 meters (or 0.008 km). The total area of those glaciers is 785,000 square kilometers. Calculate the total volume of water released by melting. (Hint: )  The surface area of the world’s oceans is 361.6 million square kilometers. When the meltwater from the land-based glaciers (that's the volume you calculated in part (d)) enters the oceans, how much will the sea level rise, in kilometers? Use the formula in part (d). Convert your answer to millimeters, and check your answer against your answer to part (b).     "

The ice component of the climate system, called the cryosphere , plays an important role in the Earth's radiation balance.  Climate models predict that global warming over the next few decades will occur mainly in the polar regions. As polar ice begins to melt, less sunlight is reflected into space, which raises the overall temperature and fuels further melting. This process is called ice albedo feedback . Since satellite monitoring began in 1979, Arctic sea ice cover has decreased about 10% per decade, falling to a startling new low in 2007.  annual sea ice minimum  Numerous factors influence the freezing point of sea water, including its salinity, or mineral content.

Slope-Intercept Form slope-intercept form linear equation slope-intercept form slope-intercept formula slope-intercept form  In earlier sections we learned that:   The -intercept y -intercept of a line gives the initial value initial value starting value initial value of .  The slope of the line gives the rate of change of with respect to .

State the meaning of the slope and the vertical intercept for this model.   linear graph of garbage deposited    The vertical intercept of the graph is . Two points on the line are and , so the slope is  , so the equation is  The slope tells us that garbage is accumulating at a rate of 12.5 tons per year.

However, if the coordinates are not easy, or if we don't have a graph, we may need another method.  You know that to calculate the net change net change between two points on a number line, we can subtract their coordinates. That is,  For example, if you walk from street to street, your distance, , from the center of town has increased by 5 blocks, or If the temperature drops from to , it has decreased by , or   The net change is positive if the variable increases, and negative if it decreases. For the graph shown at right, the net change in -coordinate from to is  horizontal change -23 to 51  We can use the notion of net change to write a coordinate formula for computing slope. We will need subscripts to designate the coordinates of two different points. We'll write for the coordinates of the first point, and for the coordinates of the second point.  Do not confuse subscripts with exponents! An exponent changes the value of a variable, so that for instance if then , but a subscript merely tells us which point the variable comes from, so that just means \"the -coordinate of the second point.\"  Coordinate Formula for Slope coordinate formula for slope slope coordinate formula for  If and are two points on a line, then the slope of the line is given by as long as   Notice that the numerator of the slope formula, , gives the net change in , or , and the denominator, , gives the net change in , or .

We want to compute the slope, between these two points. Think of moving from to in two steps, first moving horizontally to the right from to the point , and then vertically from to . The coordinates of are . (Do you see why?) Then and thus  The slope gives us a rate of change, and the units of the variables help us interpret the slope in context. Over the ten years between 1993 and 2003, wine consumption in the US increased at a rate of 6.97 million cases per year.   For more help calculating slope, see Section 1.5.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 2   Point-Slope Formula point-slope formula linear equation point-slope formula  Now we'll consider using the slope formula for a different problem. If we know the slope of a line and the coordinates of one point on the line, we can use the coordinate formula for slope to find the -coordinate of any other point on the line.  Instead of evaluating the formula to find , we substitute the values we know for and for . If we then plug in the -coordinate of any unknown point, we can solve for .  QuickCheck 3  Remember that the equation for a line is really just a formula that gives the -coordinate of any point on the line in terms of its -coordinate. So, if we know the slope of a particular line and one point on the line, we can use the coordinate formula for slope to find its equation.   Graph the line that passes through the point and has .  Find an equation for the line in part (a).      We first plot the given point, , and then use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is , so starting from we move down 3 units and then 4 units to the right. This brings us to the point . We draw the line through these two points.  point slope  To find an equation for the line, we start with the slope formula, We substitute for the slope, , and for . For the second point, , we substitute the variable point to obtain  This is an equation for the line, but if we want to solve for , we first multiply both sides by . In slope-intercept form, the equation of the line is .    For more help graphing with the point-slope form, see Section 1.5.4 of the Toolkit.  When we use the slope formula to find the equation of a line, we substitute a variable point for the second point. This version of the formula, is called the point-slope form point-slope form point-slope form point-slope formula for a linear equation. It is sometimes stated in another version by clearing the fraction to get  Point-Slope Form point-slope formula linear equation point-slope formula  The equation of the line that passes through the point and has slope is You may also see the formula written in an alternate version:   For more help using the point-slope form, see Section 1.5.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3   Finding a Linear Model linear model linear model linear equation  Now we are ready to find the equation promised in the introduction to this section: a formula for the freezing temperature of water in terms of its salinity.  When we have two data points for a linear model, we can find its equation using two steps:  first we compute the slope of the line,  then we use the point-slope formula.   Sea water does not freeze at exactly 32 F because of its salinity. The temperature at which water freezes depends on its dissolved mineral content. A common unit for measuring salinity is parts per thousand, or ppt. For example, salinity of 8 ppt means 8 grams of dissolved salts in each kilogram of water. Here are some data for the freezing temperature of water.    Salinity (ppt),      Freezing temperature ( F),       Do these data points describe a linear model? Why or why not?  Find a linear equation for freezing temperature, , in terms of salinity, .  Step 1: Find the slope.  Step 2: Use the point-slope formula.  What is the salinity of water that freezes at 32 F?  Sea water has an average salinity of 35 ppt. What is the freezing point of sea water?    We check to see if the slope between each pair of points is the same. Because the slopes are the same, the data could describe a linear model.  Step 1: In part (a) we found the slope:  Step 2: We substitute the slope and either point into the point-slope formula.  If in our equation, then must be zero, so pure water (no salinity) freezes at 32 F.  We substitute 35 for in our equation. Sea water freezes at 30.04 F.   Practice 4   Summary  In this section, we studied three different formulas associated with linear equations: the slope-intercept formula, the coordinate formula for slope, and the point-slope formula. How are these formulas related, and how are they different?   The slope-intercept form , , is just a special case of the point-slope formula . If the given point happens to be the -intercept y -intercept  , then the point-slope formula reduces to the familiar form: We can use the (shorter) slope-intercept form if we are lucky enough to know the -intercept of the line.  What is the difference between the slope formula  and the point-slope formula  They are really the same formula, but they are used for different purposes:  The slope formula is used to calculate the slope when we know two points. We know and , and we are looking for .  The point-slope formula is used to find the equation of a line. We know and , and we are looking for .

Here are some data for the freezing temperature of water.    Salinity (ppt),      Freezing temperature ( F),       Do these data points describe a linear model? Why or why not?

Sea water has an average salinity of 35 ppt. What is the freezing point of sea water?    We check to see if the slope between each pair of points is the same. Because the slopes are the same, the data could describe a linear model.  Step 1: In part (a) we found the slope:  Step 2: We substitute the slope and either point into the point-slope formula.

We can describe a relationship between variables with a table of values, a graph, or an equation.  Linear models have equations of the form:   The general form for a linear equation is: .  We can use the intercepts to graph a line. The intercepts are also useful for interpreting a model.  The graph of an equation in two variables is just a picture of all its solutions.  Lines have constant slope.  The slope of a line gives us the rate of change of one variable with respect to another.  Formulas for Linear Models   slope:  ,    slope-intercept form:     point-slopet form:      The slope-intercept form is useful when we know the initial value and the rate of change.

The Amazon rain forest is home to the largest collection of plant and animal species in the world, including more than one-third of all living species. During the 1960s, colonists began cutting down the rain forest to clear land for agriculture. The construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway in the early 1970s opened large forest areas to development by settlers and commercial interests, increasing the rate of deforestation.  Environmentalists are concerned about the loss of biodiversity which will result from destruction of the forest, and about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming.  In Brazil, the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE, or National Institute of Space Research) uses Landsat satellite photos to monitor the pace of deforestation. According to their data, the original Amazon rain forest biome in Brazil of 4,100,000 square kilometers was reduced to 3,413,000 square kilometers by 2005, representing a loss of 16.8%. The figures for 1987 to 2006 are shown at right, and a plot of the data appears below.

Although the data points do not all lie exactly on a straight line, they are very close. One question we might ask is: If deforestation continues at the same rate, when will the Amazon rain forest disappear completely? In this section we learn to find a linear model that approximates a data set.   Line of Best Fit least-squares regression line line of best fit least-squares regression line linear regression line of best fit  In most cases, a mathematical model is not a perfect description of reality. Many factors can affect empirical data, including measurement error, environmental conditions, and the influence of related variables. Nonetheless, we can often find an equation that approximates the data in a useful way.  The table shows the minimum wage in the US at five-year intervals. (Source: Economic Policy Institute)    Year  1960  1965  1970  1975  1980  1985  1990  1995  2000   Min. wage  1.00  1.25  1.60  2.10  3.10  3.35  3.80  4.25  5.15    Let represent the number of years after 1960, and plot the data. Are the data linear?  Draw a line that \"fits\" the data.    scatterplot of minimum wage     The graph shown is called a scatterplot scatterplot . The data are not strictly linear, because the slope is not constant: from 1960 to 1965, the minimum wage increased at an average rate of and from 1970 to 1975, the minimum wage increased at a rate of However, the data points do appear to lie close to an imaginary line.   We would like to draw a line that comes as close as possible to all the data points, even though it may not pass precisely through any of them. In particular, we try to adjust the line so that we have the same number of points above the line and below the line. One possible solution is shown in the figure at right.  scatterplot of minimum wage    To see more examples of line of best fit, see Section 2.1.2 of the Toolkit.  A line that fits the data in a scatterplot is called a regression line regression line regression line linear regression line regression . Drawing a regression line by eye is a subjective process. Using technology, we can compute a particular regression line called the least-squares regression line least-squares regression line linear regression least-squares regression line , which is widely used in statistics and modeling.  We can still find an equation for a line of best fit using the point-slope formula . (To review using the point-slope formula, see Finding a Linear Model in Section 1.5.) We choose two points on the line whose coordinates we can estimate fairly accurately. Note that these two points need not be any of the original data points.  QuickCheck 1  Practice 1  To review finding the equation of a line, see Section 2.1.3 of the Toolkit.   Interpolation and Extrapolation extrapolation linear regression extrapolation interpolation linear regression interpolation  An outdoor snack bar collected the following data showing the number of cups of cocoa, , they sold when the high temperature for the day was Celsius.

Find an equation for the regression line.  Use your equation to predict the number of cups of cocoa that will be sold when the temperature is , and when the temperature is    The scatterplot and a regression line are shown in the figure.  scatterplot with regression line  The regression line need not pass through any of the data points, but it should be as close as possible. We try to draw the regression line so that there are an equal number of data points above and below the line.  The points and appear to lie on the regression line. According to this model, the snack bar will sell 32 cups of cocoa when the temperature is , and 12 cups when it is . These values are close to the actual data, but not exact.  To find an equation for the regression line, we use two points on the line not data points! We will use and . First we compute the slope Next, we apply the point-slope formula. We'll use the point .  When , We predict that the snack bar will sell 29 or 30 cups of cocoa when the temperature is . When , Because the snack bar cannot sell cups of cocoa, this prediction is not useful. (What is the Fahrenheit equivalent of 24°C?)   Using a regression line to estimate values between known data points is called interpolation interpolation linear regression interpolation . If the data points lie fairly close to the regression line, then interpolation will usually give a fairly accurate estimate. In the Example above, the estimate of 29 or 30 cups of cocoa at seems reasonable in the context of the data.  Making predictions beyond the range of known data is called extrapolation extrapolation linear regression extrapolation . Extrapolation can often give useful information, but if we try to extrapolate too far beyond our data, we may get unreasonable results. The conditions that produced the data may no longer hold, as in the Example above, or other unexpected conditions may arise to alter the situation.  QuickCheck 2  Practice 2   Scatterplots  The data in a scatterplot may show a linear trend, even though the individual points are not clustered closely around a line. Scattering of data is common in the social sciences, where many variables may influence a particular situation. Nonetheless, by analyzing the data, we may be able to detect a connection between some of the variables.  The world's population is growing at different rates in different nations. Many factors, including economic and social forces, influence the birthrate. Is there a connection between birth rates and education levels? The figure below shows the birth rate plotted against the female literacy rate in 148 countries.  scatterplot birth rate and female literacy   Draw a line of best fit for the data points.

The Center for Disease Control considers a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 to be healthy. In 2002, Miss America was 5'3\" tall and weighed 110 pounds. Calculate her BMI.

Then graph this line and compare to your estimated line of best fit.  Do thinner people have higher or lower BMI scores than fatter people? Use the definition of BMI to explain your reasoning.  The Center for Disease Control considers a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 to be healthy. In 2002, Miss America was 5'3\" tall and weighed 110 pounds. Calculate her BMI. (You will need to convert inches to meters and pounds to kilograms.)  What BMI score does the regression line predict for Miss America 2002?  There are no data points for the years 1928 to 1932. What happened during those years that might cause this gap?  "

To begin, think about the two equations in the next Investigation.  Water Level  When sailing upstream in a canal or a river that has rapids, ships must sometimes negotiate locks to raise them to a higher water level. Suppose your ship is in one of the lower locks, at an elevation of 20 feet. The next lock is at an elevation of 50 feet. Water begins to flow from the higher lock to the lower one, raising your level by 1 foot per minute, and simultaneously lowering the water level in the next lock by 1.5 feet per minute.  Fill in the table    (minutes)  Lower lock water level  Upper lock water level                           Let stand for the number of minutes the water has been flowing.  Write an equation for , the water level in the lower lock after minues.  Write an equation for , the water level in the upper lock after minues.   Graph both your equations on the grid.  grid  When will the water level in the two locks be 10 feet apart?  When will the water level in the two locks be the same?  Write an equation you can use to verify your answer to part (5), and solve it.     Systems of Equations  A biologist wants to know the average weights of two species of birds in a wildlife preserve. She sets up a feeder whose platform is actually a scale and mounts a camera to monitor the feeder. She waits until the feeder is occupied only by members of the two species she is studying, robins and thrushes. Then she takes a picture, which records the number of each species on the scale and the total weight registered.  From her two best pictures, she obtains the following information. The total weight of 3 thrushes and 6 robins is 48 ounces, and the total weight of 5 thrushes and 2 robins is 32 ounces. The biologist writes two equations about the photos. She begins by assigning variables to the two unknown quantities: In each of the photos, So the two equations are  To review writing an expression for a linear model, see Section 2.2.1 of the Toolkit.  This pair of equations is an example of a linear system of two equations in two unknowns system of equations linear system (or a linear system, for short). A solution solution to a system of equations system of equations solution to the system is an ordered pair of numbers, , that satisfies both equations in the system.  QuickCheck 1   Solving Systems by Graphing system of equations graphing  Recall that every point on the graph of an equation represents a solution to that equation, so a solution to both equations must be a point that lies on both graphs. Therefore, a solution to the system is a point where the two graphs intersect.   The figure at right shows a graph of the system about robins and thrushes. The two lines appear to intersect at the point , so we expect that the values and are the solution to the system. We can check by verifying that these values satisfy both equations in the system  two lines in first quadrant  Both equations are true, so we have found the solution: a thrush weighs 4 ounces on average, and a robin weighs 6 ounces.  To review solutions of linear systems, see Section 2.2.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2  We can use a calculator or graphing utility to graph the equations in a system.  Use your grapher to solve the system by graphing.   We set the graphing window to        and enter the two equations. We can see in the figure that the two lines intersect in the third quadrant. We use the TRACE feature to find the coordinates of the intersection point, . The solution to the system is , .  GC display of 2 lines intersecting in 3rd quadrant   To learn about graphing equations with GeoGebra, see Appendix B.  The values we obtain from a calculator may be only approximations, so it is a good idea to check the solution algebraically. In the example above, we find that both equations are true when we substitute and .  Practice 1  Because the TRACE feature does not show every point on a graph, we may not find the exact solution to a system by tracing the graphs.  Solve the system  We can graph this system in the standard window by solving each equation for . We enter and use the standard window. If we trace along the graph to the intersection point, we will not find the same coordinates on both lines. The intersection point is not displayed in this window. Instead, we can use the intersect feature of the grapher.  Follow the instructions for your grapher's intersect feature to find the intersection point, , .  We can substitute these values into the original system to check that they satisfy both equations.   Practice 2  How does the calculator find the exact coordinates of the intersection point? In the next section we’ll learn how to find the solution of a system using algebra.   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems dependent system system of equations system of equations inconsistent  Because two straight lines do not always intersect at a single point, a system of linear equations does not always have a unique solution. In fact, there are three possibilities, as illustrated below.  3 cases for 2x2 linear system, namely two lines intersecting in a single point, two parallel lines, or two coincident lines  Solutions of Linear Systems linear system system of equations system of equations solution solution to a system of equations consistent system of equations system of equations consistent and independent inconsistent system system of equations system of equations inconsistent system of equations dependent system of equations independent  There are three types of linear system linear system :  Consistent and independent system independent system system of equations . The graphs of the two lines intersect in exactly one point. The system has exactly one solution.  Inconsistent system inconsistent . The graphs of the equations are parallel lines and hence do not intersect. An inconsistent system has no solutions.  Dependent system dependent . All the solutions of one equation are also solutions to the second equation, and hence are solutions of the system. The graphs of the two equations are the same line. A dependent system has infinitely many solutions.   Solve each system.     We can use technology to graph both equations on the same axes. First, we rewrite the second equation in slope-intercept form by solving for . We enter the equations as You should see that the lines do not intersect within the viewing window; they appear to be parallel. If we look again at the equations of the lines, we recognize that both have slope but different -intercepts, so they are parallel. Because parallel lines never meet, there is no solution to the system.  This time we will graph by hand. We begin by writing each equation in slope-intercept form.   For the second equation,  one line with two equations  The two equations are actually different forms of the same equation. They are equivalent, so they share the same line as a graph. Every point on the first line is also a point on the second line, and hence a solution of the system. The system has infinitely many solutions.  QuickCheck 3  Practice 3  Graph for part (a):  parallel lines    Applications  Systems of equations are useful in many applied problems. Here are two examples from economics.  A business venture calculates its profit profit by subtracting its costs cost from its revenue revenue , the amount of money it takes in from sales. Cost is usually calculated as the sum of fixed costs, or overhead, and variable costs, the cost of labor and materials to produce its product. Revenue is the product of the selling price per item times the number of items sold. If the company’s revenue exactly equals its costs (so that their profit is zero), we say that the business venture will break even break even .  To see more examples of the profit equation, see Section 2.2.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4  Another example involves supply and demand. The owner of a retail business must try to balance the demand for his product from consumers with the supply he can obtain from manufacturers. Supply and demand both vary with the price of the product: consumers usually buy fewer items if the price increases, but manufacturers will be willing to supply more units of the product if its price increases.  The demand equation demand equation equation demand gives the number of units of the product that consumers will buy at a given price. The supply equation supply equation equation supply gives the number of units that the producer will supply at that price. The price at which the supply and demand are equal is called the equilibrium price equilibrium price . This is the price at which the consumer and the producer agree to do business.  A woolens mill can produce yards of fine suit fabric if it can charge dollars per yard. The mill's clients in the garment industry will buy yards of wool fabric at a price of dollars per yard. Find the equilibrium price and the amount of fabric that will change hands at that price.   Step 1  We choose variables for the unknown quantities.   Price per yard:   Number of yards:    Step 2  The supply equation tells us how many yards of fabric the mill will produce for a price of dollars per yard. The demand equation tells us how many yards of fabric the garment industry will buy at a price of dollars per yard.  Step 3  We graph the two equations on the same set of axes, as shown below. We set the window values to and use the TRACE or the intersect command to locate the solution. The graphs intersect at the point .  GC graph of supply and demand of wool fabric  Step 4  The equilibrium price is $12 per yard, and the mill will sell 4800 yards of fabric at that price.

  "body": "Algebraic Solution of Systems   In the previous section we used graphs to solve a system of two linear equations in two unknowns. Graphs help us visualize the system and its solution, but do not always provide the most efficient or most accurate way to find the solution. In this section we review two methods for solving a 2x2 linear system algebraically.   Substitution Method system of equations substitution method substitution method system of equations  You may be familiar with the substitution method for solving a system of equations. The idea is to write an expression for one of the variables in terms of the other variable, and then substitute that expression into the other equation.  Solve the system   If we solve the first equation for , we get . We can substitute the expression for into the second equation to get an equation in only one variable. Finally, we solve this equation: And because , we find . The solution is . We may sometimes write the solution as an ordered pair, .   Here is a summary of the steps for solving a system by substitution.  To Solve a System by Substitution   Choose one of the variables in one of the equations. (It is best to choose a variable whose coefficient is or .) Solve the equation for that variable.  Substitute the result of Step 1 into the other equation. This gives an equation in one variable.  Solve the equation obtained in Step 2. This gives the solution value for one of the variables.  Substitute this value into the result of Step 1 to find the solution value of the other variable.    QuickCheck 1  Practice 1   Elimination Method elimination method elimination method system of equations system of equations elimination method  A second algebraic method for solving systems is called elimination . As with the substitution method, we obtain an equation in a single variable, but we do it by eliminating one of the variables in the system. We must first put both equations into the general linear form .  Solve the system  First, we rewrite each equation in the form . We add the equations together by adding the left side of the first equation to the left side of the second equation, and then adding the two right sides together, as follows: Note that the -terms canceled, or were eliminated . Solving the new equation, , we find that . We are not finished yet, because we must still find the value of . We can substitute our value for into either of the original equations, and solve for . We'll use the second equation, : Thus, the solution is the point .  QuickCheck 2  In the previous Example , the elimination method worked because the coefficients of in the two equations were opposites, and . This caused the -terms to cancel out when we added the two equations together. What if the coefficients of neither nor are opposites? Then we must multiply one or both of the equations in the system by a suitable constant.  Consider the system We can eliminate the -terms if we multiply each term of the second equation by , so that the coefficients of will be opposites: Be careful to multiply each term by , not just the -term. We can now replace the second equation by its new version to obtain this system:  Practice 2  QuickCheck 3  When we add a multiple of one equation to the other we are making a linear combination linear combination  system of equations linear combination of the equations. The method of elimination is also called the method of linear combinations. Sometimes we need to multiply both equations by suitable constants in order to eliminate one of the variables.  Use linear combinations to solve the system   This time we choose to eliminate the -terms. We must arrange things so that the coefficients of the -terms are opposites, so we look for the smallest integer that both 2 and 5 divide into evenly. (This number is called the lowest common multiple lowest common multiple (LCM) , or LCM , of 2 and 5.) The LCM of 2 and 5 is 10. We want one of the coefficients of to be , and the other to be .  To achieve this, we multiply the first equation by and the second equation by . Adding these new equations eliminates the -term and yields an equation in . We solve for to find . Finally, we substitute into the first equation and solve for . The solution of the system is the point .  QuickCheck 4  Practice 3  Which method should you choose to solve a particular system? Both methods work on any linear system, but the substitution method is easier if one of the variables in one of the equations has coefficient or .   Problem Solving with Systems  If there are two unknown quantities in an applied problem, it is often more easily solved by writing a system of two equations.  Staci stocks two kinds of sleeping bags in her sporting goods store, a standard model and a down-filled model for colder temperatures. From past experience, she estimates that she will sell twice as many of the standard variety as of the down-filled. She has room to stock 84 sleeping bags at a time. How many of each variety should Staci order?  We begin by choosing variables for the unknown quantities.  We write two equations about the variables. We will solve this system using substitution. Notice that the first equation is already solved for in terms of . We substitute for in the second equation to obtain Solving for , we find . Finally, substitute this value into the first equation to find The solution to the system is , . Staci should order 56 standard sleeping bags and 28 down-filled bags.  In the next Exercise, we'll use the formula for calculating the interest, , earned on an investment.  To review the interest formula, see Section 2.3.1 of the Toolkit.  A useful application of linear systems involves mixtures. In the next Example, we use the percent formula . For instance, suppose that 35% of a class of 60 students are math majors. Then the number of math majors is  To review the percent formula, see Section 2.3.2 of the Toolkit.  A chemist wants to produce 45 milliliters of a 40% solution of carbolic acid by mixing a 20% solution with a 50% solution. How many milliliters of each should she use?  picture   We let represent the number of milliliters of the 20% solution she needs and the number of milliliters of the 50% solution. We can use a table to organize the information. The first two columns contain the variables and information given in the problem: the number of milliliters of each solution and its strength as a percent.       Number of Milliliters ( )  Percent Acid ( )  Amount of Acid ( )   20% Solution      50% Solution      Mixture      We fill in the last column of the table by using the formula . The entries in this last column give the amount of the important ingredient (in this case, milliliters of acid) in each component solution and in the mixture.       Number of Milliliters ( )  Percent Acid ( )  Amount of Acid ( )   20% Solution      50% Solution      Mixture      Now we can write two equations about the mixture problem. The first equation is about the total number of milliliters mixed together. The chemist must mix milliliters of one solution with milliliters of the other solution and end up with 45 milliliters of the mixture, so The second equation uses the fact that the acid in the mixture can only come from the acid in each of the two original solutions. We used the last column of the table to calculate how much acid was in each component, and we add these quantities to get the amount of acid in the mixture. These two equation make up a system: To simplify the system we first multiply the second equation by 100 to clear the decimals. We'll solve this system by elimination. Multiply the first equation by , and add the equations together. Solving for , we find . We substitute into the first equation to find or . The chemist needs 15 milliliters of the 20% solution and 30 milliliters of the 50% solution for the mixture.   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems  Recall that a system of two linear equations does not always have a unique solution; it may be inconsistent or dependent. The elimination method will reveal whether the system falls into one of these two cases.  Solve each system by elimination.      parallel lines  To eliminate the -terms, we multiply the first equation by 2 and add:  Both variables are eliminated, and we are left with the false statement . There are no values of or that will make this equation true, so the system has no solutions. The graph shows that the system is inconsistent.   parallel lines  To eliminate the -terms, we multiply the first equation by and add:  We are left with the true but unhelpful equation . The two equations are in fact equivalent (one is a constant multiple of the other), so the system is dependent. The graph of both equations is shown in the figure.   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems system of equations inconsistent system of equations dependent system of equations elimination method  When using elimination to solve a system:  If combining the two equations results in an equation of the form then the system is inconsistent.  If combining the two equations results in an equation of the form then the system is dependent.   Practice 6    Problem Set 2.3  Warm Up  Solve the system by substitution :   Step 1  Choose one of the equations, and solve for one of the variables.  Step 2  Substitute this new expression for or into the other equation.  Step 3  Notice that the new equation has only one variable. Solve the equation.  Step 4  Substitute the answer to Step 3 into the result of Step 1 to find the other variable. Write your solution as an ordered pair.  Solve the system by elimination :   Step 1  We choose to eliminate . Multiply the first equation by and the second equation by . (Why?)  Step 2  The coefficients of are now opposites. Add the two equations together.  Step 3  Solve the new equation for the remaining variable.  Step 4  Use substitution to find the other variable. Write your solution as an ordered pair.    Skills Practice  For Problems 3 6, solve the system by substitution or by linear combinations.           For Problems 7 and 8, clear the fractions in each equation first, then solve the system by substitution or by linear combinations.       For Problems 9 and 10, use linear combinations to identify each system as dependent, inconsistent, or consistent and independent.

The chemist must mix milliliters of one solution with milliliters of the other solution and end up with 45 milliliters of the mixture, so The second equation uses the fact that the acid in the mixture can only come from the acid in each of the two original solutions. We used the last column of the table to calculate how much acid was in each component, and we add these quantities to get the amount of acid in the mixture. These two equation make up a system: To simplify the system we first multiply the second equation by 100 to clear the decimals. We'll solve this system by elimination. Multiply the first equation by , and add the equations together. Solving for , we find . We substitute into the first equation to find or . The chemist needs 15 milliliters of the 20% solution and 30 milliliters of the 50% solution for the mixture. "

  "body": "Gaussian Reduction  Some problems involve many variables and equations. For example, scheduling airline flights or planning delivery routes can involve hundreds of variables and linear equations. There are efficient computer algorithms to solve such large systems. In this section we look at a method that can be generalized to many variables, but we will apply it to 3x3 linear systems.  3x3 Linear Systems  linear system 3x3 system of equations 3x3 --> A solution solution to system of equations to an equation in three variables, such as is an ordered triple ordered triple of numbers that satisfies the equation. For example, and are solutions to the equation above, but is not. You can verify this by substituting the coordinates into the equation to see if a true statement results. A linear equation in three variables has infinitely many solutions.   An ordered triple can be represented geometrically as a point in space using a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, as shown in the figure. The graph of a linear equation in three variables is a plane. A solution to a system of three linear equations in three variables is an ordered triple that satisfies each equation in the system. That triple represents a point where all three planes intersect.  point in 3D space    If the planes intersect in a single point, the system has a unique solution.  If there is no point that lies on all three planes (for instance, if at least two of the planes are parallel), the system is inconsistent.  If all three planes are the same, or if they intersect in a line, the system is dependent.   It is impractical to solve 3x3 systems by graphing. Even when technology for producing three-dimensional graphs is available, we cannot read coordinates on such graphs with any confidence. Thus, we will restrict our attention to algebraic methods of solving such systems.  QuickCheck 1   Back-Substitution system of equations back-subsitution back-substitution  The strategy for solving a 3x3 system is the same as the strategy for 2x2 systems: we would like to reduce the system to an equation in a single variable. Once we have found the value for that variable, we substitute its value into the other equations to find the remaining unknowns.  A special case of this technique is called back-substitution back-substitution . It works when one of the equations involves exactly one variable, and a second equation involves that same variable and just one other variable. A 3x3 system with these properties is said to be in triangular form triangular form system of equations .  Solve the system  We begin by solving the third equation to find . Then we substitute for in the second equation and solve for . Finally, we substitute for and for into the first equation to find . The solution is the ordered triple . You should verify that this triple satisfies all three equations of the system.  Practice 1   Gaussian Reduction Gaussian reduction Gaussian reduction system of equations system of equations Gaussian reduction linear combination Gaussian reduction system of equations linear combination  The method for solving a general linear system is called Gaussian reduction , after the German mathematician Carl Gauss. We use linear combinations to reduce the system to triangular form, and then use back-substitution to find the solutions.  QuickCheck 2  To obtain the triangular form, we eliminate one of the variables from each of the three equations by considering them in pairs. This results in a system that we can solve using elimination.  To review the method of elimination, see Section 2.3 of the text.  Solve the system:   We can choose any one of the three variables to eliminate first. For this example, we will eliminate . Next, we choose two of the equations, say (1) and (2), and use a linear combination: We multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (2) to produce Equation (4).  Now we have an equation involving only two variables. But we need two equations in two unknowns to find the solution. So we choose a different pair of equations, say (1) and (3), and eliminate again. We multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (3) to obtain Equation (5).  We now form a system with our new Equations (4) and (5).  Finally, we eliminate one of the remaining variables to obtain an equation in a single variable. We choose to eliminate , so we add 4 times Equation (4) to times Equation (5) to obtain Equation (6).  Now we are ready to form a triangular system. We choose one of the original equations (in three variables), one of the equations from our system, and our final equation in one variable. We choose Equations (1), (4), and (6).  This new system has the same solutions as the original system, and we can solveit by back-substitution. We first solve Equation (6) to find . Substituting 3 for in Equation (4), we find  So . Finally, we substitute for and for into Equation (1) to find  The solution to the system is the ordered triple . You should verify that this triple satisfies all three of the original equations.  We summarize the method for solving a 3x3 linear system as follows.  Steps for Solving a 3x3 Linear System linear system 3x3 system of equations 3x3 Gaussian reduction system of equations Gaussian reduction   Clear each equation of fractions and put it in standard form.  Choose two of the equations and eliminate one of the variables by forming a linear combination.  Choose a different pair of equations and eliminate the same variable.  Form a system with the equations found in steps (2) and (3). Eliminate one of the variables from this system by using a linear combination.  Form a triangular system by choosing among the previous equations. Use back-substitution to solve the triangular system.   QuickCheck 3  Practice 2  For help on clearing fractions, see Section 2.4.2 of the Toolkit.   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems  If, at any step in forming linear combinations, we obtain an equation of the form then the system is inconsistent and has no solution. If we don’t obtain such an equation, but we do obtain one of the form then the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions. system of equations inconsistent system of equations dependent  To review the inconsistent and dependent systems, see Section 2.3 of the text.  Solve the systems.     To eliminate from Equations (1) and (2), we multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (2). Because the resulting equation has no solution, the system is inconsistent .  To eliminate from Equations (1) and (3), we multiply Equation (1) by and add Equation (3). Because the resulting equation vanishes, the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions.   Practice 3  QuickCheck 4   Applications  Here are some problems that can be modeled by a system of three linear equations.  One angle of a triangle measures less than twice the second angle, and the third angle is greater than the sum of the first two. Find the measure of each angle.   Step 1:  We represent the measure of each angle by a separate variable.  Step 2:  We write the conditions stated in the problem as three equations.   Step 3:  We follow the steps for solving a linear system.  1. We write the three equations in standard form.   2 3. Because Equation (1) has no -term, it will be most efficient to eliminate from Equations (2) and (3). We add these two equations.  4. We form a system from Equations (1) and (4). We add the two equations to eliminate the variable , yielding  5. We form a triangular system using Equations (2), (1), and (5). We use back-substitution to complete the solution. We divide both sides of Equation (5) by to find . We substitute for in Equation (1) and solve for to find We substitute for and for in Equation (3) to find  Step 4:  The angles measure 52°, 28°, and 100°.   For help writing an equation in standard form, see Section 2.4.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4  For help writing equations, see Section 2.4.3 of the Toolkit.

For Problems 13 and 14, when you decide which variable to eliminate first, take advantage of the fact that one of the variables is already missing from each equation.

Finally, we eliminate one of the remaining variables to obtain an equation in a single variable. We choose to eliminate , so we add 4 times Equation (4) to times Equation (5) to obtain Equation (6).  Now we are ready to form a triangular system. We choose one of the original equations (in three variables), one of the equations from our system, and our final equation in one variable. We choose Equations (1), (4), and (6).  This new system has the same solutions as the original system, and we can solveit by back-substitution. We first solve Equation (6) to find . Substituting 3 for in Equation (4), we find  So . Finally, we substitute for and for into Equation (1) to find  The solution to the system is the ordered triple . You should verify that this triple satisfies all three of the original equations. "

  "body": " Linear Inequalities in Two Variables  To conclude this chapter on applications of linear models, we look at some uses of linear inequalities and their graphs.  Graphs of Inequalities in Two Variables  Recall that a linear inequality can have many solutions. For example, the solutions of are all numbers less than . So it should not be surprising that inequalities in two variables also have many solutions.  To review solving linear inequalities, see Section 2.5.1 of the Toolkit.  A solution solution to an inequality in two variables is an ordered pair of numbers that satisfies the inequality.  Find a solution to the inequality for  For , we have You can check that any value of greater than or equal to 8000 provides a solution when . For example, is a solution because .   We can gain some insight into the nature of the solutions if we rewrite the inequality as This inequality says that for each -value, we must choose points with -values greater than or equal to . As we saw in above, when , the solutions have -values greater than or equal to 8000. Solutions for , , and are shown in the figure. Do you see a pattern emerging?  linear inequality   The graph of the inequality must show all the points whose coordinates are solutions. We found some solutions to the inequality in above by choosing a value for and solving for . A more efficient way to find all the solutions of the inequality is to start with the graph of the corresponding equation  linear inequality, 2 variables  The graph is a straight line with slope . Any point above this line has a -coordinate greater than and hence satisfies the inequality. Thus, the graph of the inequality includes all the points on or above the line , as shown by the shaded region in the figure. Of course, the shaded points are also solutions to the original inequality, .  For example, the point is a solution, because On the other hand, the point does not lie in the shaded region because its coordinates do not satisfy the inequality.  So, just as the solutions of a linear inequality in one variable can be a portion of the -axis, the solutions of a linear inequality in two variables can be a portion of the -plane.  Practice 1  linear inequality in two variables    Finding the Solutions  Let us organize our observations from the discussion above to develop a method for finding the solutions of a linear inequality.  A linear inequality linear inequality inequality linear can be written in the form The solutions consist of the line and a half-plane half-plane on one side of that line. We shade the half-plane to show that all its points are included in the solution set.  To decide which side of the line to shade, we can solve the inequality for in terms of . If we obtain then we shade the half-plane above the line. If the inequality is equivalent to then we shade the half-plane below the line.   Graph the solutions of  First we solve the inequality for .   Then we graph the corresponding line  with -intercept is and slope . Finally, we shade the half-plane below the line. The completed graph is shown at right.  linear inequality in two variables    To review graphing lines, see Section 2.5.2 of the Toolkit.  Be careful when isolating . Remember to reverse the direction of the inequality whenever we multiply or divide by a negative number. For example, the inequality is equivalent to   An inequality that uses or instead of or is called strict strict inequality inequality strict . The graph of a strict inequality includes only the half-plane and not the line. In that case we use a dashed line for the graph of the equation to show that it is not part of the solution.  Practice 2  QuickCheck 1   Using a Test Point  A second method for graphing inequalities does not require us to solve for . Because all the solutions lie on one side of the boundary line, we only need to find one soution! Once we have graphed the boundary line, we can decide which half-plane to shade by using a test point test point for inequalities . The test point can be any point that is not on the boundary line itself.  Graph the solutions of the inequality  First, we graph the line , as shown below. We will use the intercept method. The intercepts are and , so we sketch the boundary line through those points.  Next, we choose a test point. Because does not lie on the line, we choose it as our test point. We substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality to obtain   Because this is a true statement, is a solution of the inequality. Since all the solutions lie on the same side of the boundary line, we shade the half-plane that contains the test point. In this example, the boundary line is a dashed line because the original inequality was strict.  strict linear inequality in two variables   Here is a summary of our test point method for graphing inequalities.  To Graph an Inequality Using a Test Point graph graphing an inequality using a test point test point for inequalities  Graph the corresponding equation to obtain the boundary line.  Choose a test point that does not lie on the boundary line.  Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality.  If the resulting statement is true, shade the half-plane that includes the test point.  If the resulting statement is false, shade the half-plane that does not include the test point.   If the inequality is strict, make the boundary line a dashed line.   We can choose any point for the test point as long as it does not lie on the boundary line. We chose in because the coordinates are easy to substitute into the inequality. Because is a solution, we shaded the half-plane including that point. If, for example, we choose as the test point, we find which is a false statement. Thus, is not a solution to the inequality, so the solutions must lie on the other side of the boundary line. Note that using as the test point gives us the same solutions we found in .  Practice 3  We cannot choose a test point that lies on the boundary line. In Practice 3 above, we cannot use as a test point, because it lies on the line In this case, we should choose some other point, such as or .   A simple example of of our method involves horizontal and vertical lines. Recall that the equation of a vertical line vertical line has the form where is a constant, and a horizontal line horizontal line has an equation of the form Even though only one variable appears in the equation , if we think of it as , it represents a line in the plane. Similarly, the inequality may represent the inequality in two variables Its graph is then a region in the plane.  Graph in the plane.  First, we graph the equation ; its graph is a vertical line. Because the origin does not lie on this line, we can use it as a test point. Substitute for (there is no ) into the inequality to obtain   Because this is a false statement, we shade the half-plane that does not contain the origin. We see that the graph of the inequality contains all points whose -coordinates are greater than or equal to . (Or we can use common sense to shade all points with -coordinates greater than or equal to .)  graph of x greater or equal to 2 in the plane   Practice 4   Systems of Inequalities system of inequalities inequality system of   Some applications are best described by a system of two or more inequalities. The solutions to a system of inequalities include all points that are solutions to every inequality in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system. For example, the figure at right shows the solutions of the system  system of two inequalities   Laura's diet prescribes 500 milligrams of calcium from a combination of broccoli, at 160 milligrams per serving, and zucchini, at 30 milligrams per serving. Draw a graph representing the possible combinations of broccoli and zucchini that fulfill Laura’s calcium requirements.   Step 1  Number of servings of broccoli:  Number of servings of zucchini:  Step 2  To get enough calcium, Laura must choose and so that It makes no sense to consider negative values of or of , since Laura cannot eat a negative number of servings. Thus, we have two more inequalities to satisfy:  Step 3   We graph all three inequalities on the same axes. The inequalities and restrict the solutions to lie in the first quadrant. The solutions common to all three inequalities are shown at right.  system of three inequalities   Step 4  Laura can choose any combination of broccoli and zucchini represented by points in the shaded region. For example, the point is a solution to the system of inequalities, so Laura could choose to eat servings of broccoli and serving of zucchini.

We can use interpolation or extrapolation to make estimates and predictions.  If we extrapolate too far beyond the known data, we may get unreasonable results.  A solution to a linear system is an ordered pair that satisfies both equations.  A solution to a linear system is a point where the two graphs intersect.  The graphs of the equations in an inconsistent system are parallel lines and hence to do not intersect.  The graphs of the two equations in a dependent system are the same line.  If a company's revenue exactly equals its costs (so that their profit is zero), we say that the business venture will break even .  For solving a linear system, the substitution method is easier if one of the variables in one of the equations has a coefficient of or .  If a linear combination of the equations in a system results in an equation of the form then the system is inconsistent . If an equation of the form results, then the system is dependent  The point-slope form is useful when we know the rate of change and one point on the line.  The solutions of the linear inequality  consists of the line and a half-plane on one side of that line.  To Graph an Inequality Using a Test Point   Graph the corresponding equation to obtain the boundary line.  Choose a test point that does not lie on the boundary line.  Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality.  If the resulting statement is true, shade the half-plane that includes the test point.  If the resulting statement is false, shade the half-plane that does not include the test point.  If the inequality is strict, make the boundary line a dashed line.   The solutions to a system of inequalities includes all points that are solutions to all the inequalities in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system.  A solution to an equation in three variables is an ordered triple of numbers that satisfies the equation.  To solve a linear system, we use linear combinations to reduce the system to triangular form , and then use back-substitution to find the solutions.

In linear equations, the variable cannot have any exponent other than 1, and for this reason such equations are often called first-degree first-degree equation degree (of a polynomial) equation first-degree . Now we'll consider second-degree equations, or quadratic quadratic equation equation quadratic second-degree quadratic equation second-degree quadratic equations. A quadratic equation includes the square of the variable.  Here are some examples.  Some familiar geometric formulas are quadratic equations, such as the formula for the area of a circle, .  Quadratic Equation  A quadratic equation can be written in the standard form where and are constants, and is not zero.  QuickCheck 1  We would like to be able to solve quadratic equations, use them in applications, and graph quadratic equations in two variables. Let's begin by considering some simple examples.   Graphs of Quadratic Equations quadratic equation graph of   The simplest quadratic equation in two variables is Its graph is not a straight line, but a curve called a parabola parabola , shown in the figure. You can verify the table of values below for this parabola.                      standard parabola  Be careful when squaring negative numbers. To evaluate the square of a negative number on a calculator, we must enclose the number in parentheses to show that the negative sign is included in the expression to be squared. For example,  Graph the parabola  We make a table of values and plot the points. The graph is shown below.                      parabola   To review evaluating quadratic expressions, see Section 3.1.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1  parabola    Solving Quadratic Equations  How can we solve a quadratic equation? Consider the equation First, we can solve it graphically. Look again at the graph of from Example 1. quadratic equation solving by graphing  parabola and y=5  We would like to find the -values that make . The horizontal line intersects the graph at two points with -coordinate 5, and their -coordinates are the solutions of the equation. Thus, there are two solutions, namely and .  Algebraically, we solve the equation as follows.  First, we isolate the variable. We add 4 to both sides, yielding .  Because is squared in this equation, we perform the opposite operation, or take square roots, square root square root root square root in order to solve for .  The solutions are and , as we saw on the graph.  For more on square roots, see Section 3.1.2 of the Toolkit.  Notice that we have found two solutions for this quadratic equation, whereas linear equations have at most one solution. (Sometimes they have no solution at all.) We shall see that every quadratic equation has two solutions, which may be equal. The solutions may also be complex numbers, complex number which we'll study in Chapter 4.  Solve the equation graphically and algebraically.  The figure shows the graph of   parabola and y=8  We would like to find the -values that make . The horizontal line intersects the graph at two points with -coordinates approximately and . These are the solutions of the equation.  Algebraically, we solve the equation as follows.  First, we isolate the variable. We add 7 to both sides, then multiply by 2, yielding .  Because is squared in this equation, we perform the opposite operation, or take square roots, in order to solve for .  We use a calculator to find that is approximately 5.477, or about 5.5, as we saw on the graph.   Many square roots are irrational numbers , which means that their decimal form never ends. When we round off the decimal form we have an approximation to the square root, but not its exact value. It is important to make a distinction betweeen exact values and decimal approximations.  For the example above, the exact solutions are .  The values from the calculator, , are decimal approximations to the solutions, rounded to thousandths.  QuickCheck 2   Extracting Roots  We can now solve quadratic equations of the form , where the linear term is missing, by isolating on one side of the equation, and then taking the square root of each side. This method for solving quadratic equations is called extraction of roots . extraction of roots quadratic equation  Extraction of Roots extraction of roots quadratic equation solving by extraction of roots  To solve a quadratic equation of the form   Isolate on one side of the equation.  Take the square root of each side.  Practice 2  In the next Example, we compare the steps for evaluating a quadratic expression and for solving a quadratic equation .  Tux the cat falls off a tree branch 20 feet above the ground. His height seconds later is given by .  How high is Tux above the ground 0.5 second later?  How long does Tux have to get in position to land on his feet before he reaches the ground?    We evaluate the formula for . We substitute for into the formula, and simplify. Tux is 16 feet above the ground after 0.5 second. You can also use your calculator to simplify the expression for by entering        ENTER   We would like to find the value of when Tux's height, , is zero. We substitute into the equation to obtain To solve this equation we use extraction of roots. We first isolate on one side of the equation. Next, we take the square root of both sides of the equation to find Only the positive solution makes sense here, so Tux has approximately 1.12 seconds to be in position for landing.   A graph of the Tux's height after seconds is shown below. The points corresponding to parts (a) and (b) are labeled.  graph    Geometric Formulas  The formulas for the volume and surface area of some everyday objects, such as cylinders and cones, involve quadratic expressions. We can use extraction of roots to solve problems involving these objects.  Formulas for Volume and Surface Area geometric formulas surface area of a sphere surface area of a cylinder surface area of a cone surface area of a pyramid  volume of a sphere volume of a cylinder volume of a cone volume of a pyramid  3D Objects   The volume of a can of soup is 582 cubic centimeters, and its height is 10.5 centimeters. What is the radius of the can, to the nearest tenth of a centimeter?  The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula . We substitute for and for , then solve for . The radius of the can is approximately 4.2 centimeters.  For more examples using geometric formulas, see Section 3.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3   Solving Formulas  Sometimes it is useful to solve a formula for one variable in terms of the others. You might want to know what radius you need to build cones of various fixed volumes. In that case, it is more efficient to solve the volume formula for in terms of .  The formula gives the volume of a cone in terms of its height and radius. Solve the formula for in terms of and .  Because the variable we want is squared, we use extraction of roots. First, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction. Because the radius of a cone must be a positive number, we use only the positive square root: .  Practice 4  QuickCheck 3   More Extraction of Roots extraction of roots  We can also use extraction of roots to solve quadratic equations of the form We start by isolating the squared expression, .  Solve the equation .  First, we isolate the perfect square, . This gives us two equations for , The solutions are and . You can check that both of these solutions satisfy the original equation.   Practice 5  QuickCheck 4   An Application: Compound Interest  Many savings accounts offer interest compounded annually: compound interest compound interest principal at the end of each year the interest earned is added to the principal, and the interest for the next year is computed on this larger sum of money. After years, the amount of money in the account is given by the formula where is the original principal and is the interest rate, expressed as a decimal fraction.  We'll see more about compound interest in Section 7.1.  Carmella invests $3000 in an account that pays an interest rate compounded annually.  Write an expression for the amount of money in Carmella's account after two years.  What interest rate would be necessary for Carmella's account to grow to $3500 in two years?    We use the formula with and . Carmella's account balance will be  We substitute for in the equation. This is a quadratic equation in the variable , which we can solve by extraction of roots. First, we isolate the perfect square. Because the interest rate must be a positive number, we discard the negative solution. Carmella needs an account with interest rate , or over 8%, in order to have an account balance of $3500 in two years.   The formula for compound interest also applies to calculating the effects of inflation. For instance, if there is a steady inflation rate of 4% per year, then in two years the price of an item that costs $100 now will be  Practice 6   Problem Set 3.1  Warm Up  Simplify.

  "body": "Intercepts, Solutions, and Factors factor  In the last section, we used extraction of roots to solve quadratic equations of the form But this technique will not work on quadratic equations that also include a linear term, . Recall that the most general type of quadratic equation looks like Here is an example.  Suppose a baseball player pops up, that is, she hits the baseball straight up into the air. The height, , of the baseball after seconds is given by a formula from physics. This formula takes into account the initial speed of the ball (64 feet per second) and its height when it was hit (4 feet). The graph of this equation is shown below.  baseball popup  We would like to know when the baseball was exactly 52 feet high. To find out, we must solve the equation where we have substituted 52 for the height, . We can use the graph to solve this equation, by finding points with -coordinate 52. You can see that there are two such points, with -coordinates 1 and 3, so the baseball is 52 feet high at 1 second, and again on the way down at 3 seconds.  Can we solve the equation algebraically? Not with the techniques we know, because there are two terms containing the variable , and they cannot be combined. We will need a new method. To find this method, we are going to study the connection between:  the factors of ,  the solutions of the quadratic equation and  the -intercepts x -intercept of the graph of .  If you would like to review multiplying binomials using the \"FOIL\" method, see Section 3.2.1 of the Toolkit.   Zero-Factor Principle zero-factor principle  The method we will learn now is not like extraction of roots, or like solving linear equations, where we \"undid\" in reverse order each operation performed on the variable, like peeling an onion. This new method will seem less direct. It relies on applying a property of our number system.  Can you multiply two numbers together and obtain a product of zero? Only if one of the two numbers happens to be zero. (Try it yourself.)  Zero-Factor Principle zero-factor principle  The product of two factors equals zero if and only if one or both of the factors equals zero. In symbols,   QuickCheck 1  Here is the simplest possible application of the Zero-Factor Principle (ZFP): For what value(s) of is the equation true? You could divide both sides by 3, but you can also see that the product can equal zero only if one of its factors is zero, so must be zero!  The ZFP is true even if the numbers and are represented by algebraic expressions, such as or . For example, if then it must be true that either or This is how we can use the ZFP to solve quadratic equations.  Solve the equation  We can factor the expression , and write the equation as  Now it is in the form , with and , so the ZFP tells us that either or . We solve each of these equations. Once again we see that a quadratic equation has two solutions. You can check that both of these values satisfy the original equation.  To review factoring quadratic trinaomials, see Section 3.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1   X-Intercepts of a Parabola  Recall that the -intercept x -intercept of a line is the point where , or where the line crosses the -axis. We find the -intercept by setting in the equation of the line, and solving for . We can find the -intercepts of a parabola the same way.  Find the -intercepts of the graph of  To find the -intercepts of the graph, we set and solve the equation But this is the same equation we solved in the last Example , because The solutions of that equation were and , so the -intercepts of the graph are and . You can see this by graphing the equation on your calculator, as shown in the figure.  parabola with x-intercepts   We can state a general result: The -intercepts of the graph of are the solutions of the equation So we can always solve a quadratic equation to find the -intercepts of a parabola (if there are any).  And we can use this relationship the other way round, too: If we know the -intercepts of the graph of we also know the solutions of the equation .  Practice 2   Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring factoring solve a quadratic equation by quadratic equation solve by factoring  Now we'll consider some other quadratic equations. Before we apply the ZFP, we must write the equation so that one side is zero.  Solve  First, we write the equation in standard form. Now we factor the left side to obtain The solutions are and .  When we apply the zero-factor principle, one side of the equation must be zero. For example, to solve the equation it is incorrect to set each factor equal to 15! (There are many ways that the product of two numbers can equal 15; it is not necessary that one of the numbers be 15.)  We must first simplify the left side and write the equation in standard form. (The correct solutions are and ; check that you can find these solutions.)  We summarize the factoring method for solving quadratic equations as follows.  To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring factoring solve a quadratic equation by quadratic equation solve by factoring    Write the equation in standard form.  Factor the left side of the equation.  Apply the zero-factor principle: Set each factor equal to zero.  Solve each equation. There are two solutions (which may be equal).   Practice 3  QuickCheck 2  Now we can use factoring to solve the opening problem in this section.  The height, , of a baseball seconds after being hit is given by When will the baseball reach a height of 64 feet?  We substitute for in the formula, and solve for . There are two solutions. At seconds, the ball reaches a height of 64 feet on the way up, and at seconds, the ball is 64 feet high on its way down.   In the Example above, the factor of 4 does not affect the solutions of the equation at all. You can understand why this is true by looking at some graphs. Use technology to graph the equation in the window Notice that when , or . These two points are the -intercepts of the graph. Now on the same window graph as shown below.  graph  This graph has the same -values when . The factor of 4 makes the graph \"skinnier,\" but does not change the location of the -intercepts.  Practice 4  QuickCheck 3   An Application  Here is another example of how quadratic equations arise in applications.  The size of a rectangular computer monitor screen is taken to be the length of its diagonal. If the length of the screen should be 3 inches greater than its width, what are the dimensions of a 15-inch monitor?  We express the two dimensions of the screen in terms of a single variable: We apply the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation : To solve this equation, we begin by simplifying the left side. Because the width of the screen cannot be a negative number, the width is 9 inches, and the length is inches.  To review the Pythagorean theorem, see Section 3.1.4 of the Toolkit.  Practice 5  garden    More About Solutions of Quadratic Equations quadratic equation solutions of  As we have seen in ehe examples above, the solutions of the quadratic equation are and . This is called the factored form factored form factored form quadratic equation of the quadratic equation. Thus, if we know the two solutions of a quadratic equation, we can work backwards to reconstruct the equation.  Find a quadratic equation whose solutions are and .  Each solution corresponds to a factor of the equation, so the equation must look like this: or, simplifying: We multiply the factors together to obtain This is an equation that works, but we can make a \"nicer\" one if we clear the fractions. We can multiply both sides of the equation by 2. We know that multiplying by a constant does not change the solutions of the equation. By factoring, we can check that this equation really does have the given solutions. From here, you can see that the solutions are indeed and .   Practice 6  A quadratic equation in one variable always has two solutions. In some cases, the solutions may be equal. For example, the equation can be solved by factoring as follows: Both of these equations have solution . We say that 1 is a solution of multiplicity two multiplicity quadratic equation multiplicity , meaning that it occurs twice as a solution of the quadratic equation.  QuickCheck 4   Problem Set 3.2  Warm Up  For Problems 1-4, write each product as a polynomial in simplest form.

For problems 21-24, solve by extracting roots.       For problems 25 and 26, graph the equation and locate the -intercepts of the graph. Use the -intercepts to write the quadratic expression in factored form.     Use technology to graph all three equations in the same window. What do you notice about the -intercepts?    All three graphs have the same -intercepts.  Write a quadratic equation with the given solutions.

Introduction  The graph of any quadratic equation is a parabola parabola (if ). In this section we'll make a systematic study of the parabolas we've met earlier in the chapter. Some typical parabolas are shown below.  two parabolas with labeled features  To begin, notice that these parabolas share certain features.  The graph has either a highest point (if the parabola opens downward, as in figure (a) or a lowest point (if the parabola opens upward, as in figure (b). This high or low point is called the vertex vertex of a parabola of the graph.  The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line, called the axis of symmetry axis of symmetry parabola axis of symmetry axis of symmetry axis of symmetry parabola symmetry axis of symmetry , that runs through the vertex.  A parabola has a -intercept y -intercept , and it may have zero, one, or two -intercepts x -intercept .  If there are two -intercepts, they are equidistant from the axis of symmetry.   The values of the constants , , and determine the location and orientation of the parabola. We'll consider each of these constants separately.  QuickCheck 1   The Graph of  Use your calculator to graph the following three equations in the standard window, as shown below:  3 parabolas  You can see that the graph of is narrower than the basic parabola, and the graph of is wider. As increases, the graph of increases faster than the basic parabola, and the graph of increases more slowly. Compare the corresponding -values for the three graphs shown in the table.                        For each -value, the points on the graph of are higher than the points on the basic parabola, while the points on the graph of are lower. Multiplying by a positive constant greater than 1 stretches the graph vertically, and multiplying by a positive constant less than 1 squashes the graph vertically.  What about negative values for ? Consider the graphs of  parabolas  We see that multiplying by a negative constant reflects the graph about the -axis. These parabolas open downward.  The Graph of   The parabola opens upward if  The parabola opens downward if  The magnitude of determines how wide or narrow the parabola is.  The vertex, the -intercepts, and the -intercept all coincide at the origin.   Sketch by hand a graph of each quadratic equation.     Both equations have the form . The graph of opens upward because , and the graph of opens downward because .  To make a reasonable sketch by hand, it is enough to plot a few guidepoints ; the points with -coordinates and are easy to compute.   two vertically scaled parabolas                     We sketch parabolas through each set of guidepoints, as shown at left.

Compare the graphs of  vertically shifted parabolas  The graph of is shifted upward four units compared to the basic parabola, and the graph of is shifted downward four units. Look at the table, which shows the -values for the three graphs.

Describe the graph of the equation  The graph in the standard window is shown below. We see that the axis of symmetry for this parabola is not the -axis: the graph is shifted to the left, compared to the basic parabola. We find the -intercepts of the graph by setting equal to zero:  The solutions of this equation are and , so the -intercepts are the points and .  shifted parabola  To review solving quadratic equations, see Section 3.3.2 of the Toolkit.  We can find the vertex of the graph by using the symmetry of the parabola. The -coordinate of the vertex lies exactly half-way between the -intercepts, so we average their -coordinates to find:   To review the average of two numbers, see Section 3.3.1 of the Toolkit.  To find the -coordinate of the vertex, substitute into the equation for the parabola: Thus, the vertex is the point .

  "body": " Completing the Square completing the square  Not every quadratic equation can be solved easily by factoring or by extraction of roots. If the solutions are not integers, the expression may be very difficult to factor. For example, the equation cannot be solved easily by either of these methods. In this section we learn a method that will solve any quadratic equation.  Squares of Binomials  We can use extraction of roots to solve equations of the form where the left side of the equation includes the square of a binomial, or a perfect square perfect square . It turns out that we can write any quadratic equation in this form.  Study the following squares of binomials. binomial square of    Square of binomial      1.      2.      3.      In each case, the square of the binomial is a quadratic trinomial quadratic trinomial , The coefficient of the linear term, , is twice the constant in the binomial, and the constant term of the trinomial, , is its square.  For more examples of squares of binomials, see Section 3.4.1 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 1  We would like to reverse the process and write a quadratic expression as the square of a binomial. For example, what constant term can we add to to produce a perfect square trinomial? Compare the expression to the formula above: We see that , so We substitute these values for and into the equation to find You can check that in the resulting trinomial, the constant term is equal to the square of one-half the coefficient of  . In other words, we can find the constant term by taking one-half the coefficient of and then squaring the result. Adding a constant term obtained in this way is called completing the square completing the square .  Complete the square by adding an appropriate constant; write the result as the square of a binomial.      One-half of is , so the constant term is , or . We add to obtain  One-half of is , so the constant term is , or .  We add to obtain   To review multiplying and adding fractions, see Section 3.4.2 and Section 3.4.3 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2  Practice 1   Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square quadratic equation solving by completing the square  Now we will use completing the square to solve quadratic equations. First, we will solve equations in which the coefficient of the squared term is 1. Consider the equation  Step 1 To begin, we move the constant term to the other side of the equation, to get  Step 2 Next, we complete the square on the left. Because we add to both sides of our equation to get  Step 3 The left side of the equation is now the square of a binomial, namely . We write the left side in its square form and simplify the right side, which gives us  Step 4 We can now use extraction of roots to find the solutions. Taking square roots of both sides, we get The solutions are and .  To review extracting roots, see Section 3.1.4 .  In Step 3, you can check that this equation is equivalent to the original one; if you expand the left side and collect like terms, you will return to the original equation:   parabola with line of symmetry   The graph of is shown at left. Notice that the -intercepts of the graph are and , and the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line halfway between the intercepts, at .   We can also solve by factoring instead of completing the square. Of course, we get the same solutions by either method. In the next Example, we solve an equation that cannot be solved by factoring.  Solve by completing the square.    We write the equation with the constant term on the right side.  We complete the square on the left side. The coefficient of is , so We add to both sides of our equation:  We write the left side as the square of a binomial, and combine terms on the right side:  Finally, we use extraction of roots to obtain These are the exact values of the solutions. We use a calculator to find decimal approximations for each solution: These values are the -intercepts of the graph of , as shown below.  parabola showing x-intercepts and line of symmetry   QuickCheck 3  Practice 2   The General Case  Our method for completing the square works only if the coefficient of is 1. If we want to solve a quadratic equation whose lead coefficient is not 1, we first divide each term of the equation by the lead coefficient.  Solve .   Because the coefficient of is , we must divide each term of the equation by . Now we proceed as before. Rewrite the equation with the constant on the right side.  Complete the square: Add to both sides of our equation:  Rewrite the left side as the square of a binomial and simplify the right side to get  Finally, extract roots and solve each equation for . The solutions are and .  Using a calculator, we can find decimal approximations for the solutions: and .   In , it is essential that we first divide each term of the equation by , the coefficient of . The following attempt at a solution is incorrect . You can check that is not equal to . We have not written the left side of the equation as a perfect square, so the solutions we obtain by extracting roots will not be correct.  Practice 3  Here is a summary of the steps for solving quadratic equations by completing the square.  To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square quadratic equation solving by completing the square    Write the equation in standard form.  Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the quadratic term, and subtract the constant term from both sides.  Complete the square on the left side:  Multiply the coefficient of the first-degree term by one-half, then square the result.  Add the value obtained in (a) to both sides of the equation.  Write the left side of the equation as the square of a binomial. Simplify the right side.  Use extraction of roots to finish the solution.    Problem Set 3.4  Warm Up   Solve by factoring  Solve by extraction of roots   Expand each square.            Skills Practice  Add a term to make a square of a binomial.

The graph of a quadratic equation is called a parabola . The basic parabola is the graph of .  Extraction of Roots  To solve a quadratic equation of the form   Isolate on one side of the equation.  Take the square root of each side.  Every quadratic equation has two solutions, which may be the same.  Solutions of a quadratic equation can be given as exact values or as decimal approximations.  Formulas for Volume and Surface Area  Sphere  Cylinder  Cone  Square Pyramid  The formula for interest compounded annually is  Zero-Factor Principle : The product of two factors equals zero if and only if one or both of the factors equals zero. In symbols,  To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring   Write the equation in standard form.  Factor the left side of the equation.  Apply the zero-factor principle: Set each factor equal to zero.  Solve each equation. There are two solutions (which may be equal).  Each solution of a quadratic equation corresponds to a non-constant factor in the factored form.  The value of the constant in the factored form of a quadratic equation does not affect the solutions.  The -intercepts of the graph of are the solutions of the equation .  The Graph of   The parabola opens upward if  The parabola opens downward if  The magnitude of determines how wide or narrow the parabola is.  The vertex, the -intercepts, and the -intercept all coincide at the origin.   The Graph of  Compared to the graph of , the graph of  is shifted upward by units if  is shifted downward by units if   For the graph of , the -coordinate of the vertex is  The square of a binomial is a quadratic trinomial,  To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square    Write the equation in standard form.  Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the quadratic term, and subtract the constant term from both sides.  Complete the square on the left side:  Multiply the coefficient of the first-degree term by one-half, then square the result.  Add the value obtained in (a) to both sides of the equation.  Write the left side of the equation as the square of a binomial. Simplify the right side.  Use extraction of roots to finish the solution.      Chapter 3 Review Problems   For Problems 1 6, solve by extraction of roots.          For Problems 7 10, solve by factoring.        For Problems 11 and 12, write a quadratic equation with integer coefficients and with the given solutions.  and  and    For Problems 13 and 14, graph the equation using the ZDecimal setting. Locate the -intercepts, and use them to write the quadratic expression in factored form.      For Problems 15 18,  Find the coordinates of the vertex and the intercepts.  Sketch the graph.

  "body": " Quadratic Formula quadratic formula  A New Formula  Instead of completing the square every time we solve a new quadratic equation, we can complete the square on the general quadratic equation, and obtain a formula for the solutions of any quadratic equation. Here is the resulting formula.  The Quadratic Formula quadratic formula quadratic equation solve using the quadratic formula  The solutions of the equation are  The formula gives us the solutions of a particular quadratic equation in terms of its coefficients, and . We know that there should be two solutions, and the symbol is used to represent the two expressions in a single formula.  To review some properties of radicals, see Section 4.1.1 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 1  To solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, all we have to do is substitute the coefficients and into the formula.  Solve .  Write the equation in standard form as We substitute for , for , and for into the quadratic formula, then simplify. Remeber that we cannot cancel the 4's in this expression! Using a calculator, we find that the solutions are approximately and . These values are the -intercepts of the graph of as shown in the figure.  parabola with irrational x-intercepts  For more about the order of operations with radicals, see Section 4.1.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1  To see more examples of using the quadratic formula, see Section 4.1.3 of the Toolkit.   Applications  We have now seen four different algebraic methods for solving quadratic equations:  Factoring  Extraction of roots  Completing the square  Quadratic formula Factoring and extraction of roots are relatively fast and simple, but they do not work on all quadratic equations. The quadratic formula will work on any quadratic equation.  QuickCheck 2  The owners of a day-care center plan to enclose a divided play area against the back wall of their building, as shown below. They have feet of picket fence and would like the total area of the playground to be square feet. Can they enclose the playground with the fence they have, and if so, what should the dimensions of the playground be?  two fenced rectangles against wall   Suppose the width of the play area is feet. Because there are three sections of fence along the width of the play area, that leaves feet of fence for its length.  The area of the play area should be square feet, so we have the equation This is a quadratic equation. We use the distributive law and write the equation in standard form. The left side of this equation cannot be factored, so we use the quadratic formula with , , and . When we evalute this last expression, we get two different positive values for the width of the play area, or . Both values give solutions to the problem. To find the length of the playground in each case, we substitute into   If the width of the play area is feet, the length is , or feet.  If the width is feet, the length is , or feet.   The dimensions of the play area can be 72.4 feet by 82.8 feet, or it can be 27.6 feet by 217.2 feet.   Practice 2   Complex Numbers complex number  Not all quadratic equations have solutions that are real numbers. For example, when we try to solve the equation , we find Although square roots square root of a negative real number square root of a negative real number imaginary number root square root of negative numbers such as are not real numbers, they occur frequently in mathematics and its applications. Mathematicians in the sixteenth century gave them the name imaginary numbers imaginary number , which reflected the mistrust with which they were viewed at the time. Today, however, such numbers are well understood and are used routinely by scientists and engineers.  To help us work with imaginary numbers, we define a new number, i , the imaginary unit imaginary unit i , whose square is .  Imaginary Unit i   With this new number we define the principal square root of any negative real number as follows.  Imaginary Numbers imaginary number  If ,  Thus, the square root of any negative real number can be written as the product of a real number and . Every negative real number has two imaginary square roots. For example, the square roots of are and . You can verify that     Practice 3  The solutions of many quadratic equations involve imaginary numbers.  Solve .  For this equation, , , and . We substitute these values into the quadratic formula to obtain We write the solutions as Because the solutions are not real numbers, the graph of has no -intercepts, as shown below.  parabola no x-intercepts   The sum of a real number and an imaginary number is called a complex number .  Practice 4   Number of -Intercepts  The graph of the quadratic equation may have two, one, or no -intercepts, according to the number of distinct real-valued solutions of the equation . For example, consider the three graphs shown at right.  parabolas with zero, one, or two x-intercepts    The graph of has two -intercepts, because the equation has two real-valued solutions, and .  The graph of has only one -intercept, because the equation has only one (repeated) real-valued solution, .  The graph of has no -intercepts, because the equation has no real-valued solutions.  A closer look at the quadratic formula reveals useful information about the solutions of quadratic equations. The sign of the number under the radical determines how many solutions the equation has. For the three equations above, we calculate as follows:   From these examples, we see that the solutions of a quadratic equation always occur in conjugate pairs conjugate pair conjugate pair conjugate pair complex conjugate , For example, if we know that one solution of a particular quadratic equation is , the other solution must be . If one solution is , the other solution must be .  The expression , which appears under the radical in the quadratic formula, is called the discriminant discriminant , , of the equation. The value of the discriminant determines the nature of the solutions of the equation. In particular, if the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real-valued solutions; the solutions are complex numbers.  The Discriminant discriminant complex conjugate complex conjugate conjugate pair  The discriminant of a quadratic equation is   If , there are two unequal real solutions.  If , there is one solution of multiplicity two.  If , there are two complex conjugate solutions.  Use the discriminant to discover how many -intercepts the graph has.      We set and compute the discriminant for the resulting equation.  . The equation has two real, unequal solutions, and the graph has two -intercepts.  . The equation has no real solutions, so the graph has no -intercepts.  . The equation has one real solution of multiplicity two, and the graph has a single -intercept.  QuickCheck 3  Practice 5   Solving Formulas  Sometimes it is useful to solve a quadratic equation for one variable in terms of the others.  Solve for in terms of .  We first write the equation in standard form as a quadratic equation in the variable . Expressions in are treated as constants with respect to , so that , , and . We substitute these expressions into the quadratic formula.   Practice 6   Problem Set 4.1  Warm Up  For Problems 1 and 2, simplify according to the order of operations.

Finding the Vertex  The vertex of a parabola is an interesting point. It is the highest or lowest point on the parabola, and it \"anchors\" the parabola's position in the plane. As we saw in the Investigation, the vertex may represent the maximum or minimum possible value for a variable, so it has important implications for applications. Thus, it will be very useful to have a way to find the vertex easily.  In Section 3.3.5 we saw that the vertex of the graph of has -coordinate given by Now we'll see that the same formula holds for any parabola. Use your calculator to graph the two parabolas in the window   The graphs are shown at right. Now compare the two graphs. You should notice that:  The second graph is identical to the first, except shifted upward by 6 units.  For both graphs, the -coordinate of the vertex is .    two parabolas with same symmetry line  We see that the -coordinate of the vertex is not affected by an upward shift. The formula for the -coordinate of the vertex still holds.  Vertex of a Parabola parabola vertex of vertex of a parabola  For the graph of the -coordinate of the vertex is  Find the vertex of the graph of .   For this equation, , , and . The -coordinate of the vertex is given by To find the -coordinate of the vertex, we substitute into the equation. We can do this by hand to find So the coordinates of the vertex are . Alternatively, we can use the calculator to evaluate for . We enter   (-)          and press ENTER . The calculator returns the -value . Thus, the vertex is the point , which is the decimal equivalent of .  Practice 1  Once we know the vertex of a parabola, we can make a quick sketch of the graph.  Sketch a graph of  The vertex of the graph is given by The vertex is the point .  We set to find the -intercept, . Now, the axis of symmetry of the parabola is the vertical line that passes through its vertex. That line is , so the -intercept lies 1.5 units to the right of the axis. There must be another point on the parabola with the same -coordinate as the intercept but 1.5 units to the left of the axis. This point is .  By plotting the vertex, the -intercept, and its symmetric point, we can make a quick sketch of the parabola, as shown below.  parabola   If we need more accuracy in our graph, we can find and plot more points, including the -intercepts.   To review finding the -intercepts of a parabola, see Section 3.2.2 .  Practice 2  :  parabola     Maximum or Minimum Values  Many quadratic models arise as the product of two variables, one of which increases while the other decreases. For example, in the Investigation for Section 3.3 we looked at the areas of different rectangles with the same perimeter. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and its width, or . If we require that the rectangle have a certain perimeter, then as we increase its length, we must also decrease its width.  Another example is the formula for the revenue revenue from sales of an item: Usually, when the price of an item increases, the number of items sold decreases.  Finding the maximum or minimum value for a variable expression is a common problem in applications. For example, if you own a company that manufactures blue jeans, you might like to know how much to charge for your jeans in order to maximize your revenue. As you increase the price of the jeans, your revenue may increase for a while. But if you charge too much for the jeans, consumers will not buy as many pairs, and your revenue may actually start to decrease. Is there some optimum price you should charge for a pair of jeans in order to achieve the greatest revenue?  Late Nite Blues finds that it can sell pairs of jeans per week if it charges dollars per pair. (Notice that as the price increases, the number of pairs of jeans sold decreases.)  Write an equation for the revenue as a function of the price of a pair of jeans.  Graph the function.  How much should Late Nite Blues charge for a pair of jeans in order to maximize its revenue?    Using the formula for revenue stated above, we find  We recognize the equation as quadratic, so the graph is a parabola. You can use your calculator to verify the graph below.  graph showing revenue from sales of jeans  As you can see from the graph, the maximum value of occurs at the vertex of the parabola. Thus, The revenue takes on its maximum value when , and the maximum value is . This means that Late Nite Blues should charge $20 for a pair of jeans in order to maximize revenue at $6000 a week.   If the equation relating two variables is quadratic, then the maximum or minimum value is easy to find: It is the value at the vertex. If the parabola opens downward, as in , there is a maximum value at the vertex. If the parabola opens upward, there is a minimum value at the vertex. maximum value minimum value maximum value parabola minimum value parabola  parabola maximum value quadratic equation maximum value  parabola minimum value quadratic equation minimum value  QuickCheck 1  Practice 3   The Vertex Form for a Parabola parabola vertex form vertex form for a parabola quadratic equation vertex form  Because the vertex is such a useful tool, we introduce a new form for a quadratic equation. Consider the equation By expanding the squared expression and collecting like terms, we can rewrite the equation in standard form as  The vertex of this parabola is and its graph is shown at right.  parabola with vertex labeled  To review multiplying binomials, see Section 4.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Now notice that the coordinates of the vertex, , are apparent in the original equation; we don’t need to do any computation to find the vertex. This equation is an example of the vertex form vertex form for a quadratic function.  Vertex Form for a Quadratic Equation parabola vertex form vertex form for a quadratic equation  A quadratic equation can be written in the vertex form where the vertex of the graph is .  Find the vertex of the graph of . Is the vertex a maximum or a minimum point of the graph?  We compare the equation to the vertex form to see that the coordinates of the vertex are . For this equation, , so the parabola opens downward. The vertex is the maximum point of the graph.   To understand why the vertex form works, substitute into from to find which confirms that when , . Next, notice that if is any number except , the expression is negative, so . Therefore, is the maximum value for on the graph, so is the high point or vertex.  You can also rewrite in standard form and use the formula to confirm that the vertex is the point .  QuickCheck 2  Practice 4  Any quadratic equation in vertex form can be written in standard form by expanding, and any quadratic equation in standard form can be put into vertex form by completing the square.  completing the square  To review completing the square, see Section 3.4.2 .  Write the equation in vertex form and find the vertex of its graph.  We factor the lead coefficient, , from the variable terms, leaving a space to complete the square. Next, we complete the square inside parentheses. Take half the coefficient of and square the result: We must add to complete the square. However, we are really adding to the right side of the equation, so we must also subtract to compensate: The expression inside parentheses is now a perfect square, and the vertex form is The vertex of the parabola is .  Practice 5   Using the Vertex Form  We can make a quick sketch of a parabola whose equation is given in vertex form.  Graph the equation  The vertex is the point . We can find the -intercept by setting . The -intercept is the point . The axis of symmetry is the vertical line , and there is a symmetric point equidistant from the axis, namely . We plot these three points and sketch the parabola through them.  parabola  To see more examples of sketching from the vertex form, see Section 4.2.1 of the Toolkit.

When Andre practices free-throws at the park, the ball leaves his hands at a height of 7 feet, and reaches the vertex of its trajectory 10 feet away at a height of 11 feet.  Find a quadratic equation for the ball's trajectory.  Do you think Andre's free-throw would score on a regulation basketball court, where the hoop is 15 feet from the shooter and 10 feet high?    If Andre's feet are at the origin, then the vertex of the ball's trajectory is the point , and its -intercept is . We start with the vertex form for a parabola. We use the point to find the value of . The equation of the trajectory is .  parabola  We'd like to know if the point is on the trajectory of Andre's free-throw. We substitute into the equation. From our computations, we see that the point is indeed on the trajectory. However, because Andre's shot will probably hit the backboard just where the hoop attaches and bounce off, so it is unlikely that his shot will score.

In this section we'll see how to fit a quadratic equation to a collection of data points.   Finding a Quadratic Equation through Three Points quadratic equation find using three points  Every linear equation can be written in the form To find a specific line we must find values for the two parameters parameter quadratic equation parameters parameter quadratic equation (constants) and . We need two data points in order to find those two parameters. A quadratic equation, however, has three parameters, and : To find these parameters we need three data points.  To review points on a graph, see Section 4.3.1 of the Toolkit.  Find values for , , and so that the points , , and lie on the graph of .  We substitute the coordinates of each of the three points into the equation of the parabola to obtain three equations: or, equivalently, This is a system of three equations in the three unknowns , , and . To solve the system, we use Gaussian reduction. We first eliminate . We subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2) to obtain and then subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3) to get We now have a system of two linear equations in two variables: Next, we eliminate from Equations (4) and (5): we add times Equation (4) to times Equation (5) to get                            or . We substitute for in Equation (4) to find Finally, we substitute for and for in Equation (1) to find Thus, the equation of the parabola is The parabola and the three points are shown below.  parabola through-3 specified points   To review Gaussian reduction, see Section 4.3.3 . To see more examples of elimination, see Section 4.3.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 1  Practice 1  parabola     Applications  The simplest way to fit a parabola to a set of data points is to pick three of the points and find the equation of the parabola that passes through those three points.  Major Motors Corporation is testing a new car designed for in-town driving. The data below show the cost of driving the car at different speeds. The speeds, , are given in miles per hour, and the cost, , includes fuel and maintenance for driving the car miles at that speed.                  Find a possible quadratic model, that expresses in terms of .  When we plot the data, it is clear that the relationship between and is not linear, but it may be quadratic, as shown at right.  We will use the last three data points, , , and , to fit a parabola to the data. We would like to find the coefficients , , and of a parabola that includes the three data points. This gives us a system of equations:  scatterplot points following parabola shape    Eliminating from Equations (1) and (2) yields Equation (4), and eliminating from Equations (2) and (3) yields Equation (5). Eliminating from Equations (4) and (5) gives us  We substitute this value into Equation (4) to find , then substitute both values into Equation (1) to find .  Thus, our quadratic model is The graph of this equation, along with the data points, is shown at right.  parabola fitting nonlinear scatterplot   As was the case with linear regression, the graph of the regression equation may not pass through all of the data points, but it should be close to most of them.  Practice 2  scatterplot and parabola fit   QuickCheck 2   Using a Calculator for Quadratic Regression  We can use a graphing calculator or other technology to find an approximate quadratic fit for a set of data. The procedure is similar to the steps for linear regression.    Use your calculator to find a quadratic fit for the data in .  How many of the given data points actually lie on the graph of the quadratic approximation?    We press STAT  ENTER and enter the data under columns and , as shown below. Next, we calculate the quadratic regression equation and store it in by pressing STAT    VARS     ENTER .  The regression equation has the form , where , , and . Notice that , , and are all close to the values we computed in .  GC lists and GC quadratic regression output  Next, we will graph the data and the regression equation. We press Y= and select Plot1 , then press ZOOM  to see the graph shown below. The parabola seems to pass close to all the data points.  However, try using either the value feature or a table to find the -coordinates of points on the regression curve. By comparing these -coordinates with our original data points, we find that none of the given data points lies precisely on the parabola.  GC plot and GC table quadratic regression output   Practice 3  Graph for part (a):  parabola fit to points    Choosing an Appropriate Model  We must be careful that our data set gives a complete picture of the situation we want to model. A regression equation may fit a particular collection of data and still be a poor model if the rest of the data diverge from the regression graph.   GC graph showing a poor linear fit for quadratic data  In , suppose Major Motors had collected only the first three data points and fit a line through them, as shown at left. This regression line gives poor predictions for the cost of driving at 60 or 70 miles per hour.   Delbert records the height of the tip of the minute hand on the classroom’s clock at different times. The data are shown in the table, where time is measured in minutes since noon. (A negative time indicates a number of minutes before noon.) Find a quadratic regression equation for the data and use it to predict the height of the minute hand's tip at 40 minutes past noon. Do you believe this prediction is valid?    Time (minutes)              Height (feet)              We enter the time data under and the height data under . Then we calculate and store the quadratic regression equation in , as we did in . The regression equation is From either the graph of the regression equation or from the table (see figure below), we can see that the fit is not perfect, although the curve certainly fits the data better than any straight line could.  GC screens of graph and tables for quadratic fit  If we scroll down the table, we find that this equation predicts a height of approximately 4.08 feet at time 40 minutes. (See figure (c).) This is a preposterous estimate! The position of the minute hand at 40 minutes after noon should be the same as it was exactly one hour earlier (at 20 minutes before noon), when it was 7.50 feet.  Using the wrong type of function to fit the data is a common error in making predictions. In the Example above, we know that the minute hand of a clock repeats its position every 60 minutes. The graph of the height of its tip oscillates up and down, repeating the same pattern over and over. We cannot describe such a graph using either a linear or a quadratic function.   parabola fit on part of a periodic wave  The graph of the height is shown at left, along with the graph of our quadratic regression equation. You can see that the regression equation fits the actual curve only on a small interval.   Even though your calculator can always compute a regression equation,that equation is not necessarily appropriate for your data. Choosing a reasonable type of regression equation for a particular data set requires knowledge of different kinds of models and the physical or natural laws that govern the situation at hand.

To review solving with a graph, see Section 1.2.4   The Chamber of Commerce in River City plans to put on a Fourth of July fireworks display. City regulations require that fireworks at public gatherings explode higher than 800 feet above the ground. The mayor particularly wants to include the Freedom Starburst model, which is launched from the ground. Its height after t seconds is given by When should the Starburst explode in order to satisfy the safety regulation?  We can get an approximate answer to this question by looking at the graph of the rocket's height, shown below.  graph of fireworks height  We would like to know when the rocket's height is greater than 800 feet, or, in mathematical terms, for what values of is ? The answer to this question is the solution of the inequality Points on the graph with are shown in color, and the -coordinates of those points are marked on the horizontal axis. If the Freedom Starburst explodes at any of these times, it will satisfy the safety regulation.  From the graph, the safe time interval runs from approximately 4.25 seconds to 11.75 seconds after launch. The solution of the inequality is the set of all -values greater than 4.25 but less than 11.75.  The solution set in is called a compound inequality compound inequality inequality compound , because it involves more than one inequality symbol. We write this inequality as and read \" greater than 4.25 but less than 11.75.\"  QuickCheck 1  Solving an Inequality With a Graphing Calculator  You can use your graphing calculator to solve the problem in .

Practice 1  :  parabola for quadratic inequality    Using the -Intercepts x -intercept  Because it is easy to decide whether the -coordinate of a point on a graph is positive or negative (the point lies above the -axis or below the -axis), we often rewrite a given inequality so that one side is zero.  Use a graph to solve  We first write the inequality with zero on one side: . We would like to find points on the graph of that have -coordinates greater than or equal to zero. A graph of the equation is shown below.   You can check that the -intercepts of the graph are and . The points shown in blue on the graph lie above the -axis and have , so the -coordinates of these points are the solutions of the inequality.  parabola dividing the x-axis into three regions   Note that the solutions lie in two intervals, less than or greater than . Thus, the solution is or .  To review finding the -intercepts of a parabola, see Section 4.4.2 of the Toolkit.  In above, the solution of the inequality is the set of values This set is another type of compound inequality, compound inequality inequality compound and its graph consists of two pieces. Therefore, we cannot write the solution as a single inequality. For instance, it would be incorrect to describe the solution set as , because this notation implies that .

Every quadratic inequality can be put into one of the forms All we really need to know is whether the corresponding parabola opens upward or downward. Consider the parabolas shown below.  parabola opens up, the other opens down  The parabola in figure (a) opens upward. It crosses the -axis at two points, and . At these points, .  The graph lies below the -axis between and , so the solutions to the inequality lie between and .  The graph lies above the -axis for -values less than or greater than , so the solutions to the inequality are or .   If the parabola opens downward, as in figure (b), the situation is reversed. The solutions to the inequality lie between the -intercepts, and the solutions to lie outside the -intercepts.  From the graphs, we see that the -intercepts are the boundary points between the portions of the graph with positive -coordinates and the portions with negative -coordinates. To solve a quadratic inequality, we need only locate the -intercepts of the corresponding graph and then decide which intervals of the -axis produce the correct sign for .  To solve a quadratic inequality algebraically inequality quadratic quadratic inequality algebraic solution   Write the inequality in standard form: One side is zero, and the other has the form .  Find the -intercepts x -intercept of the graph of by setting and solving for .  Make a rough sketch of the graph, using the sign of to determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward.  Decide which intervals on the -axis give the correct sign for .  Solve the inequality algebraically.   We subtract 20 from both sides of the inequality so that we have 0 on the right side.  Consider the equation . To locate the -intercepts, we set and solve for . The -intercepts are and .  Make a rough sketch of the graph of , as shown below. Because , the graph is a parabola that opens downward.  parabola opening down dividing x-axis into 3 parts  We are interested in points on the graph for which . The points with negative -coordinates (that is, points below the -axis) lie outside the -intercepts of the graph, so the solution of the inequality is or . Or, using interval notation, the solution is .   Many people think that the inequality signs in the solution should point in the same direction as the sign in the original problem, and hence would incorrectly write the solution to as or . However, you can see from the graph that this is incorrect. Remember that the graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola, not a straight line!  Practice 4  QuickCheck 4   Applications  If we cannot find the -intercepts of the graph by factoring or extraction of roots, we can use the quadratic formula.  TrailGear, Inc. manufactures camping equipment. The company finds that the profit from producing and selling alpine parkas per month is given, in dollars, by How many parkas should the company produce and sell each month if it must keep the profits above $2000?   We would like to solve the inequality or, subtracting from both sides,  Consider the equation We locate the -intercepts of the graph by setting and solving for . We will use the quadratic formula to solve the equation so , , and . We substitute these values into the quadratic formula to obtain  To two decimal places, the solutions to the equation are 122.54 and 277.46.  The graph of the equation is a parabola that opens downward, because the coefficient of is negative.  graph of parabola opening down  The graph lies above the -axis, and hence , for -values between the two -intercepts, that is, for . Because we cannot produce a fraction of a parka, we restrict the interval to the closest whole number -values included, namely 123 and 277.  Thus, TrailGear can produce as few as 123 parkas or as many as 277 parkas per month to keep its profit above $2000.   To review the quadratic formula, see Section 4.1 .

The first two methods are faster, but they do not work on all equations. The last two methods work on any quadratic equation.  The imaginary unit , , is defined by .  The square root of any negative number can be written as the product of a real number (the square root of its absolute value) and .  The sum of a real number and an imaginary number is called a complex number .  The graph of the quadratic equation may have two, one, or no -intercepts, according to the number of distinct real-valued solutions of the equation .  The Discriminant  The discriminant of a quadratic equation is   If , there are two unequal real solutions.  If , there is one solution of multiplicity two.  If , there are two complex conjugate solutions.  Every quadratic equation has two solutions, which may be the same.  For the graph of , the -coordinate of the vertex is To find the -coordinate of the vertex, we substitute into the formula for the parabola.  Quadratic models may arise as the product of two variables.  The maximum or minimum of a quadratic equation occurs at the vertex of its graph.  Vertex Form for a Quadratic Equation  A quadratic equation can be written in the vertex form where the vertex of the graph is .  We can convert a quadratic equation to vertex form by completing the square.  We need the coordinates of three points to find the equation of a parabola.  We can use the method of elimination to find the equation of a parabola through three points.  If we know the vertex of a parabola, we need only one other point to find its equation.  We can use quadratic regression to fit a parabola to a collection of data points from a quadratic model.  We can use a graphical technique to solve quadratic inequalities.  To solve a quadratic inequality algebraically   Write the inequality in standard form: One side is zero, and the other has the form .  Find the -intercepts of the graph of by setting and solving for .  Make a rough sketch of the graph, using the sign of to determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward.  Decide which intervals on the -axis give the correct sign for .   We can write the solution set to a quadratic inequality in interval notation.  Interval Notation   The closed interval  is the set .  The open interval  is the set .  Intervals may also be half-open or half-closed .  The infinite interval  is the set .  The infinite interval  is the set .   To graph a quadratic equation   Determine whether the parabola opens upward (if ) or downward (if ).  Locate the vertex of the parabola.  The -coordinate of the vertex is .  Find the -coordinate of the vertex by substituting into the equation of the parabola.  Locate the -intercepts (if any) by setting and solving for .  Locate the -intercept by evaluating for .  Locate the point symmetric to the -intercept across the axis of symmetry.      Chapter 4 Review Problems   For Problems 1 4, solve by using the quadratic formula.        For Problems 5 and 6, solve the formula for the indicated variable.  for  for    For Problems 7 10, use the discriminant to determine the nature of the solutions of the equation.  one repeated real solution  two complex soutions  two complex soutions  two distinct real soutions   The height, , of an object seconds after being thrown from ground level is given by where is its starting velocity and is a constant that depends on gravity.

For example, in the early 16th-century, Spanish troops introduced smallpox into the Aztec population in Central America, and the resulting epidemic contributed significantly to the fall of Montezuma’s empire.  Suppose that an outbreak of cholera follows severe flooding in an isolated town of 5000 people. Initially (Day 0), 40 people are infected. Every day after that, 25% of those still healthy fall ill.   At the beginning of the first day (Day 1), how many people are still healthy? How many will fall ill during the first day? What is the total number of people infected after the first day?  Check your results against the table below. Subtract the total number of infected residents from 5000 to find the number of healthy residents at the beginning of the second day.

Summarize your work: In your own words, describe how the number of residents infected with cholera changes with time. Include a description of your graph.    Definitions and Notation  We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For example, when a physician prescribes a drug in a certain dosage, she needs to know how long the dose will remain in the bloodstream. A sales manager needs to know how the price of his product will affect its sales. A function function is a special type of relationship between variables that allows us to make such predictions.  We have already seen some examples of functions. For instance, suppose it costs $800 for flying lessons, plus $30 per hour to rent a plane. If we let represent the total cost for hours of flying lessons, then The variable is called the input variable, and is the output variable. Given a value of the input, we can calculate the corresponding output value using the formula for the function. Thus, for example       when  ,    when  ,    when  ,    We can display the relationship between two variables by a table or by ordered pairs. The input variable is the first component of the ordered pair, and the output variable is the second component. For the example above we have:                    Note that there can be only one value of for each value of . We say that \" is a function of .\"  Definition of Function  A function function is a relationship between two variables for which exactly one value of the output function output variable output variable function variable is determined by each value of the input function input variable input variable function variable.   QuickCheck 1   The distance, , traveled by a car in 2 hours is a function of its speed, . If we know the speed of the car, we can determine the distance it travels by the formula .  The cost of a fill-up with unleaded gasoline is a function of the number of gallons purchased. The gas pump represents the function by displaying the corresponding values of the input variable (number of gallons) and the output variable (cost).  Score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is not a function of score on an IQ test, because two people with the same score on an IQ test may score differently on the SAT; that is, a person’s score on the SAT is not uniquely determined by his or her score on an IQ test.   Practice 1  A function can be described in several different ways. In the following examples, we consider functions defined by tables, by graphs, and by equations.   Functions Defined by Tables  When we use a table to describe a function, the first variable in the table (the left column of a vertical table or the top row of a horizontal table) is the input variable, and the second variable is the output. We say that the output variable is a function of the input.   The table below shows data on sales compiled over several years by the accounting office for Eau Claire Auto Parts, a division of Major Motors. In this example, the year is the input variable, and total sales is the output. We say that total sales, , is a function of  .    Year  Total sales   2000  $612,000   2001  $663,000   2002  $692,000   2003  $749,000   2004  $904,000   The table below gives the cost of sending a letter by first-class mail in 2022.     Weight in ounces  Postage    $0.60    $0.84    $1.08    $1.32    $1.56    $1.80    $2.04   If we know the weight of the article being mailed, we can find the postage from the table. For instance, a catalog weighing 4.5 ounces would require $1.56 in postage. In this example, is the input variable and is the output variable. We say that  is a function of  .  The table below records the age and cholesterol count for 20 patients tested in a hospital survey.    Age  Cholesterol count   Age  Cholesterol count   53  217      48  232   53  241   55  198   49  186   56  238         57  208   52  264   52  248   53  195   50  214   47  203   56  271   48  212   53  193   50  234   48  172   According to these data, cholesterol count is not a function of age, because several patients who are the same age have different cholesterol levels. For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a unique value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a person’s cholesterol count.   Note that several different inputs for a function can have the same output. For example, the inputs 4.5 and 4.25 in part (b) of above have output $1.56. However, a single input cannot have more than one output, as illustrated in part (c) of the Example .  Practice 2 Decide whether each table describes as a function of . Explain your choice.  QuickCheck 2   Functions Defined by Graphs  We can also use a graph to define a function. The input variable is displayed on the horizontal axis, and the output variable on the vertical axis.   The graph shows the number of hours, , that the sun is above the horizon in Peoria, Illinois, on day , where on January 1.    Which variable is the input, and which is the output?  How many hours of sunlight are there in Peoria on day 150?  On which days are there 12 hours of sunlight?  What are the maximum and minimum values of , and when do these values occur?   Peoria sunlight hours    The input variable, , appears on the horizontal axis. The number of daylight hours, , is a function of the date. The output variable appears on the vertical axis.  The point on the curve where has , so Peoria gets about 14.1 hours of daylight when , which is at the end of May.  at the two points where (in late March) and (late September).  The maximum value of 14.4 hours occurs on the longest day of the year, when , about three weeks into June. The minimum of 9.6 hours occurs on the shortest day, when , about three weeks into December.    Practice 3 The graph shows the elevation in feet, , of the Los Angeles Marathon course at a distance miles into the race. (Source: Los Angeles Times , March 3, 2005)  LA marathon elevation   Functions Defined by Equations  illustrates a function defined by an equation.   As of 2020, One World Trade Center in New York City is the nation’s tallest building, at 1776 feet. If an algebra book is dropped from the top of One World Trade Center, its height above the ground after seconds is given by the equation Thus, after second the book’s height is After seconds its height is For this function, is the input variable and is the output variable. For any value of , a unique value of can be determined from the equation for . We say that  is a function of  .   Practice 4  QuickCheck 3   Function Notation function notation  There is a convenient notation for discussing functions. First, we choose a letter, such as , , or (or , , or ), to name a particular function. (We can use any letter, but these are the most common choices.)  For instance, in , the height, , of a falling algebra book is a function of the elapsed time, . We might call this function . In other words, is the name of the relationship between the variables and . We write which means \" is a function of , and is the name of the function.\"  The new symbol , read \" of ,\" is another name for the height, . The parentheses in the symbol do not indicate multiplication. (It would not make sense to multiply the name of a function by a variable.) Think of the symbol as a single variable that represents the output value of the function.  With this new notation we may write or just instead of to describe the function.  Perhaps it seems complicated to introduce a new symbol for , but the notation is very useful for showing the correspondence between specific values of the variables and .   In , the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of One World Trade Center is given by the equation We see that   Using function notation, these relationships can be expressed more concisely as   which we read as \" of 1 equals 1760\" and \" of 2 equals 1712.\" The values for the input variable, , appear inside the parentheses, and the values for the output variable, , appear on the other side of the equation.  Remember that when we write , the symbol is just another name for the output variable.  For more examples of function terminology, see Section 5.1.1 of the Toolkit.  Function Notation  Function notation   QuickCheck 4  Practice 5 Let be the name of the function defined by the graph in , the number of hours of daylight in Peoria days after January 1.  QuickCheck 5   Using Function Notation  Finding the value of the output variable that corresponds to a particular value of the input variable is called evaluating the function evaluating the function .   Let be the name of the postage function defined by the table in b. Find , , and ).  According to the table,    when ,    so    when ,    so    when ,    so    Thus, a letter weighing 1 ounce costs $0.60 to mail, a letter weighing 3 ounces costs $1.08, and a letter weighing 6.75 ounces costs $1.04.  We can also find the input (or inputs) corresponding to a given output. For example, if is the postage function, we solve the equation by finding all input values, , that correspond to the output $0.84. According to the table in part (b), any value of greater than 1 but less than or equal to 2 is a solution.  Practice 6  QuickCheck 6  To evaluate a function described by an equation, we simply substitute the given input value into the equation to find the corresponding output, or function value.   The function is defined by Evaluate the function at the following values.      . Thus, .  . Thus, .

DJIA  The graph describes a function because there is only one value of the output, DJIA, for each value of the input, . There is no formula that gives the DJIA for a particular day; but it is still a function, defined by its graph. The value of is specified by the vertical coordinate of the point with the given -coordinate.   The coordinates of point on the DJIA graph are . What do the coordinates tell you about the function ?  If the DJIA was 1726 at noon on October 20, what can you say about the graph of ?    The coordinates of point tell us that , so the DJIA was 2412 at noon on October 15.  We can say that , so the point lies on the graph of . This point is labeled in the figure above.   The coordinates of each point on the graph of the function give the output for a specific input.

To find , we look for the point with -coordinate . The point lies on the graph of , so . Similarly, the point lies on the graph, so .  We look for points on the graph with -coordinate . Because the points , , and lie on the graph, we know that , , and . Thus, the -values we want are , , and .  The highest point on the graph is , so the largest -value is . Thus, the maximum value of is , and it occurs when .  A graph is increasing if the -values get larger as we read from left to right. The graph of is increasing for -values between and , and between and . Thus, is increasing on the intervals and .   For more practice with function notation, see Section 5.2.1 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2  Practice 2 Refer to the graph of the function shown in .  graph of a function    Constructing the Graph of a Function  We can construct a graph for a function described by a table or an equation. We make these graphs the same way we graph equations in two variables: by plotting points whose coordinates satisfy the equation.  Graph the function  We choose several convenient values for and evaluate the function to find the corresponding -values. For this function we cannot choose -values less than , because the square root of a negative number is not a real number.     The results are shown in the table.                       square root graph  Points on the graph have coordinates , so the vertical coordinate of each point is given by the value of . We plot the points and connect them with a smooth curve, as shown in the figure. Notice that no points on the graph have -coordinates less than .  QuickCheck 3  Using Technology to Graph a Function  We can also use a graphing utility to obtain a table and graph for the function in . We graph a function just as we graphed an equation. For this function, we enter and press ZOOM  for the standard window. Your calculator does not use the notation for graphs, so we will continue to use etc. for the output variable. Don't forget to enclose in parentheses, because it appears under a radical. The graph is shown below.  GC square root graph   Practice 3 cubic   The Vertical Line Test  In a function, two different outputs cannot be related to the same input. This restriction means that two different ordered pairs cannot have the same first coordinate. What does it mean for the graph of the function?  Consider the graph shown in Figure (a). Every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, so there is only one point on the graph for each -value. This graph represents a function.  vertical line test  In Figure (b), however, the line intersects the graph at two points, and . Two different -values, 1 and 4, are related to the same -value, 2. This graph cannot be the graph of a function.  The Vertical Line Test function vertical line test vertical line test function  A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.  Use the vertical line test to decide which of the graphs in the figure represent functions.  vertical line test   Graph (a) represents a function, because it passes the vertical line test.  Graph (b) is not the graph of a function, because the vertical line at (for example) intersects the graph at two points.  For graph (c), notice the break in the curve at : The solid dot at is the only point on the graph with ; the open circle at indicates that is not a point on the graph. Thus, graph (c) is a function, with .

We can also use a graphical technique to solve equations and inequalities involving other functions.  Use a graph of to solve the equation  If we sketch in the horizontal line , we can see that there are three points on the graph of that have -coordinate , as shown below. The -coordinates of these points are the solutions of the equation.  graph of cubic  From the graph, we see that the solutions are , , and approximately . We can verify each solution algebraically.  For example, if , we have so is a solution. Similarly, you can check that and are solutions.

In the next example, is used in this way.  TrailGear decides to market a line of backpacks. The cost, , of manufacturing backpacks is a function of the number of backpacks produced, , given by the equation where is in dollars. Find the cost of producing 500 backpacks.  To find the value of that corresponds to , we evaluate : The cost of producing 500 backpacks is $13,000.

Many functions fall into families or classes of similar functions, and recognizing the appropriate family for a given situation is an important part of modeling.  We'll need two new algebraic operations.  Cube Roots  You are familiar with square roots. Every non-negative number has two square roots, defined as follows. There are several other kinds of roots, one of which is called the cube root . We define the cube root as follows.  Cube Root cube root root cube root  is the cube root of if cubed equals . In symbols, we write  Square roots of negative numbers are not real (they are complex), but every real number has a real cube root. For example, Simplifying radicals occupies the same position in the order of operations as computing powers: after parentheses, and before products and quotients.  Simplify each expression.           For more examples of cube roots, see Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1  QuickCheck 1  We can use the calculator to find cube roots as follows. Press the MATH key to get a menu of options. Option 4 is labeled ; this is the cube root key. To find the cube root of, say, 15.625, we key in  MATH  4    ENTER and the calculator returns the result, 2.5. Thus, . You can check this result by verifying that .   Absolute Value  We use the absolute value to discuss problems involving distance. For example, consider the number line below. Starting at the origin, we travel in opposite directions to reach the two numbers and , but the distance we travel in each case is the same.  absolute value  The distance from a number to the origin is called the absolute value absolute value function absolute value absolute value of , denoted by . Because distance is never negative, the absolute value of a number is always positive (or zero). Thus, and . In general, we define the absolute value of a number as follows.  Absolute Value  The absolute value absolute value of is defined by   This definition is called piecewise , because the formula has two pieces. It says that the absolute value of a positive number (or zero) is the same as the number. To find the absolute value of a negative number, we take the opposite of the number, which is then positive. For instance,  QuickCheck 2  Absolute value bars act like grouping devices in the order of operations: you should complete any operations that appear inside absolute value bars before you compute the absolute value.  Simplify each expression.       We simplify the expression inside the absolute value bars first.  We simplify each absolute value; then subtract.   For more examples using absolute value, see Section 5.3.2 and Section 5.3.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 2  QuickCheck 3   Eight Basic Graphs graph eight basic  Most of the graphs in this section will be new to you, but many useful graphs are variations of the eight basic functions shown below.  Consider the first pair of graphs. You have already studied the graph of , the basic parabola. Compare that graph with the graph of . Notice several differences in the shape of the two graphs. Once you have a good idea of the shape of a graph, up can make a quick sketch with just a few \"guide points.\" For these two graphs, complete a short table of values to find useful guide points:                         graphs  The next pair of graphs are and . Once again, notice the differences in the two graphs. For example, we cannot take the square root of a negative number, but we can take its cube root. How is this reflected in the graphs?   square root graph  cube root graph  The next pair of functions, and , are both undefined at , so thier graphs do not include any points with -coordinate zero. For very small positive values of , both and get very large. As gets closer to zero, the graphs approach the vertical line (the -axis). This line is called a vertical asymptote vertical asymptote asymptote vertical for the graph.  Also, notice that for very large values of , both and get very close to zero. Their graphs approach the horizontal line (the -axis). This line is called the horizontal asymptote asymptote horizontal horizontal asymptote for the graph.  graphs  Finally, compare the familiar graph of with the graph of . The piecewise definition of means that we graph in the first quadrant (where ), and in the first quadrant ). The result is the V-shaped graph shown below.   y=x  y=abs(x)  Because they are fundamental to further study of mathematics and its applications, you should become familiar with the properties of these eight graphs, and be able to sketch them easily from memory, using their basic shapes and a few guidepoints.   Problem Set 5.3  Warm Up  Evaluate each function.        For Problems 2 and 3, compute each cube root. Round your answers to three decimal places if necessary. Verify your answers by cubing them.                  For Problems 4 6, simplify each by following the order of operations.               For problems 7 10, simplify the expression according to the order of operations.

  "body": " Direct Variation  Two types of functions are widely used in modeling and are known by special names: direct variation function direct variation and inverse variation function inverse variation .  Proportion and Variation direct variation variation direct variation  Two variables are directly proportional directly proportional directly proportional direct variation (or just proportional proportional directly ) if the ratios of their corresponding values are always equal. Consider the functions described in the tables below. The first table shows the price of gasoline as a function of the number of gallons purchased.    Gallons of gasoline  Total price  Price\/ Gallons                         Years  Population  People\/Years                           The ratio , or price per gallon, is the same for each pair of values in the first table. This agrees with everyday experience: The price per gallon of gasoline is the same no matter how many gallons you buy. Thus, the total price of a gasoline purchase is directly proportional to the number of gallons purchased.  The second table shows the population of a small town as a function of the town’s age. The ratio gives the average rate of growth of the population in people per year. You can see that this ratio is not constant; in fact, it increases as time goes on. Thus, the population of the town is not proportional to its age.  QuickCheck 1  The graphs of the two functions described above by tables (the gasoline price and the small town population tables) are shown below.  graphs of gas price and population growth  We see that the price, , of a fill-up is a linear function of the number of gallons, , purchased. This should not be surprising if we write an equation relating the variables and . Because the ratio of their values is constant, we can write where is a constant. In this example, the constant is , the price of gasoline per gallon. Solving for in terms of , we have which we recognize as the equation of a line through the origin.  If is proportional to , we also say that varies directly with , and we make the following definition.  Direct Variation direct variation varies directly   varies directly with if where is a positive constant called the constant of variation constant of variation direct variation constant of variation .    The circumference, , of a circle varies directly with its radius, , because The constant of variation is , or about 6.28.  The amount of interest, , earned in one year on an account paying 7% simple interest, varies directly with the principal, , invested, because   In the opening example, we saw that the price of gasoline, , is a linear function of the number of gallons purchased. From the definition above, we see that any direct variation defines a linear function of the form Compareing this equation to the standard form for a linear function, , we see that the constant term, , is zero, so the graph of a direct variation passes through the origin. The positive constant in the equation is just the slope of the graph, so it tells us how rapidly the graph increases. direct variation  Practice 1  graphs of three lines   QuickCheck 2   The Scaling Property of Direct Variation  Because the graph of passes through the origin, direct variation has the following scaling property: if we double the value of , then the value of will double also. In fact, increasing by any factor causes to increase by the same factor. Look again at the table for the price of buying gasoline. Doubling the number of gallons of gas purchased, say, from gallons to gallons or from gallons to gallons, causes the total price to double also.  QuickCheck 3    Tuition at Woodrow University is $400 plus $30 per unit. Is the tuition proportional to the number of units you take?  Imogen makes a 15% commission on her sales of environmentally friendly products marketed by her co-op. Do her earnings vary directly with her sales?    Let represent the number of units you take, and let represent your tuition. Then Thus, is a linear function of , but the -intercept is , not . Your tuition is not proportional to the number of units you take, so this is not an example of direct variation. You can check that doubling the number of units does not double the tuition. For example, and Tuition for units is not double the tuition for units. The graph of in figure (a) does not pass through the origin.  calculator graphs of two linear functions  Let represent Imogen’s sales, and let represent her commission. Then Thus, is a linear function of with a -intercept of zero, so Imogen's earnings do vary directly with her sales.   Practice 2   Finding a Formula for Direct Variation direct variation finding a formula for  If we know any one pair of values for the variables in a direct variation, we can find the constant of variation. Then we can use the constant to write a formula for one of the variables as a function of the other.  If you kick a rock off the rim of the Grand Canyon, its speed, , varies directly with the time, , it has been falling. The rock is falling at a speed of 39.2 meters per second when it passes a lizard on a ledge 4 seconds later.  Express as a function of .  What is the speed of the rock after it has fallen for 6 seconds?  Sketch a graph of versus .    Because varies directly with , there is a positive constant for which . We substitute and and solve for to find Replacing by , we find the formula .  We evaluate the function found in part (a) for . At seconds, the rock is falling at a speed of 58.8 meters per second.  You can use your calculator to graph the function . The graph is shown below.  GC graph   Practice 3  QuickCheck 4   Direct Variation with a Power of  In many situations, is proportional to a power of , instead of itself.  Direct Variation with a Power direct variation with a power   varies directly varies directly with a power of if where and are positive constants.   The surface area of a sphere varies directly with the square of its radius. A balloon of radius 5 centimeters has surface area square centimeters, or about 314 square centimeters.  Find a formula for the surface area of a sphere as a function of its radius .  What is the radius of a sphere whose surface area is square centimeters,or about 628 square centimeters?  Sketch a graph of the function.    If stands for the surface area of a sphere of radius , then To find the constant of variation, , we substitute the values of and . Thus, .  We solve the variation equation for when . The radius is centimeters, or about 7.1 centimeters.  The graph has the shape of the basic function , so all we need are a few points to \"anchor\" the graph. We know that , and or about . A graph is shown below.  (Need graph here)   For more examples of direct variation, see Section 5.4.1 , Section 5.4.2 , and Section 5.4.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4  In any example of direct variation, as the input variable increases through positive values, the output variable increases also. Thus, a direct variation is an increasing function, increasing function increasing function increasing graph as we can see when we consider the graphs of some typical direct variations shown below.  graphs of three variation with power  The graph of a direct variation always passes through the origin, so when the input is zero, the output is also zero. Thus, the functions and , for example, are not direct variation, even though they are increasing functions for positive .  QuickCheck 5  Even without an equation, we can check whether a table of data describes direct variation or merely an increasing function. If varies directly with , then , or, equivalently,  Test for Direct Variation direct variation test for test for direct variation  If the ratio is constant, then varies directly with .  Delbert collects the following data and would like to know if varies directly with the square of . What should he calculate?                  If varies directly with , then , or . Delbert should calculate the ratio for each data point.                         Because the ratio is not constant, does not vary directly with .   Practice 5   Scaling scaling property of direct variation direct variation scaling property  If varies directly with , then doubling causes to double also. But what if varies directly with a power of :  Is the area of a -inch circular pizza double the area of an -inch pizza?  If you double the dimensions of a model of a skyscraper, will its weight double also?   You probably know that the answer to both of these questions is No . The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius, and the volume (and hence the weight) of an object is proportional to the cube of its linear dimension. Variation with a power of produces a different scaling effect.  The Taipei 101 building is 1671 feet tall, and in 2006 it was the tallest skyscraper in the world. Show that doubling the dimensions of a model of the Taipei 101 building produces a model that weighs 8 times as much.  The Taipei 101 skyscraper is approximately box shaped, so its volume is given by the product of its linear dimensions, . The weight of an object is proportional to its volume, so the weight, , of the model is where the constant depends on the material of the model. If we double the length, width, and height of the model, then The weight of the new model is times the weight of the original model.  Practice 6  In general, if varies directly with a power of , that is, if , then doubling the value of causes to increase by a factor of . In fact, if we multiply by any positive number , then so the value of is multiplied by .  We will call the scaling exponent scaling exponent direct variation scaling exponent exponent scaling , and you will often see variation described in terms of scaling. For example, we might say that \"the area of a circle scales as the square of its radius.\" (In many applications, the power is called the scale factor , even though it is not a factor but an exponent.)

  "body": " Functions as Models  The Shape of the Graph  To create a good model we first decide what kind of function to use. What sort of function has the right shape to describe the process we want to model? Should it be increasing or decreasing, or some combination of both? Is the slope constant or is it changing?  In Examples and , we investigate how the shape of a graph illustrates the nature of the process it models.   Forrest leaves his house to go to school. For each of the following situations, sketch a possible graph of Forrest's distance from home as a function of time.  Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop.  Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop; then he waits there until the bus arrives.  Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop, waits there until the bus arrives, and then the bus drives him to school at a constant speed.    The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in figure (a). It begins at the origin because at the instant Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when .) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrest’s walking speed.  distance from home  The first part of the graph is the same as part (a). But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in figure (b). The line has slope because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is .  The graph begins like the graph in part (b). The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in figure (c).   Practice 1  piecewise graph   The graphs in are portions of straight lines. We can also consider graphs that bend upward or downward. The bend is called the concavity concavity concavity concave up, concave down graph concavity of the graph.  The two functions described in this example are both increasing functions, but they increase in different ways. Match each function to its graph and to the appropriate table of values.   The number of flu cases reported at an urban medical center during an epidemic is an increasing function of time, and it is growing at a faster and faster rate.  The temperature of a potato placed in a hot oven increases rapidly at first, then more slowly as it approaches the temperature of the oven.                                   increasing graphs of opposite concavity    The number of flu cases is described by graph (A) and table (1). The function values in table (1) increase at an increasing rate. We can see this by computing the rate of change over successive time intervals. The increasing rates can be seen inthe figure below; the graph bends upward as the slopes increase.  cocave up graph  The temperature of the potato is described by graph (B) and table (2). The function values in table (2) increase, but at a decreasing rate. The decreasing slopes can be seen in the figure below. The graph is increasing but bends downward.  cocave down graph   A graph that bends upward is called concave up concave up graph concave up , and one that bends down is concave down concave down graph concave down .  Practice 2  decreasing graphs of opposite concavity   QuickCheck 1   Using the Basic Functions as Models  We have considered situations that can be modeled by linear or quadratic functions. In this section we'll look at a few of the other basic functions.  Choose one of the eight basic functions to model each situation, and sketch a possible graph.   The number of board-feet, , that can be cut from a Ponderosa pine is a function of the cube of the circumference, , of the tree at a standard height.  The manager of an appliance store must decide how many coffee-makers to order every quarter. The optimal order size, , is a function of the square root of the annual demand for coffee-makers, .  The loudness, or intensity, , of the music at a concert is a function of the reciprocal of the square of your distance, , from the speakers.    cubic   square root   inverse square   For more about the basic functions, see Section 5.6.1 of the Toolkit.

The speed of sound is a function of the temperature of the air in kelvins. (The temperature, , in kelvins is given by , where is the temperature in degrees Celsius.) The table shows the speed of sound, , in meters per second, at various temperatures, .                     Plot the data to obtain a graph. Which of the basic functions does your graph most resemble?  Find a value of so that fits the data.  On a summer night when the temperature is Celsius, you see a flash of lightning, and 6 seconds later you hear the thunderclap. Use your function to estimate your distance from the thunderstorm.    The graph of the data is shown below. The shape of the graph reminds us of the square root function, .  speed of sound  We are looking for a value of so that the function fits the data. We substitute one of the data points into the formula and solve for . If we choose the point , we obtain and solving for yields . We can check that the formula is a good fit for the rest of the data points as well. Thus, we suggest the function as a model for the speed of sound.  First, we use the model to calculate the speed of sound at a temperature of Celsius. The Kelvin temperature is so we evaluate for . Thus, is approximately 343.4 meters per second.  The lightning and the thunderclap occur simultaneously, and the speed of light is so fast (about 30,000,000 meters per second) that we see the lightning flash as it occurs. So if the sound of the thunderclap takes seconds after the flash to reach us, we can use our calculated speed of sound to find our distance from the storm. The thunderstorm is 2060 meters, or about 1.3 miles, away.   Practice 4  two concave up decreasing curves   QuickCheck 3  At this point, a word of caution is in order. There is more to choosing a model than finding a curve that fits the data. A model based purely on the data is called an empirical model empirical model model empirical . However, many functions have similar shapes over small intervals of their input variables, and there may be several candidates that model the data. Such a model simply describes the general shape of the data set; the parameters parameter of the model do not necessarily correspond to any actual process.  In contrast, mechanistic models mechanistic models model mechanistic provide insight into the biological, chemical, or physical process that is thought to govern the phenomenon under study. Parameters derived from mechanistic models are quantitative estimates of real system properties. Here is what GraphPad Software has to say about modeling:  \"Choosing a model is a scientific decision. You should base your choice on your understanding of chemistry or physiology (or genetics, etc.). The choice should not be based solely on the shape of the graph.  \"Some programs . . . automatically fit data to hundreds or thousands of equations and then present you with the equation(s) that fit the data best. Using such a program is appealing because it frees you from the need to choose an equation. The problem is that the program has no understanding of the scientific context of your experiment. The equations that fit the data best are unlikely to correspond to scientifically meaningful models. You will not be able to interpret the best-fit values of the variables, and the results are unlikely to be useful for data analysis.\"  (Source: Fitting Models to Biological Data Using Linear and Nonlinear Regression , Motulsky & Christopoulos, GraphPad Software, 2003)   The Absolute Value and Distance distance (absolute value)  The absolute value function is used to model problems involving distance. Recall that the absolute value of a number gives the distance from the origin to that number on the number line.  QuickCheck 4  We can find the distance from a number to some point other than the origin, say , by computing . For instance, the distance on the number line from to is  Distance and Absolute Value  The distance between two points and is given by .   For example, the equation means \"the distance between and is units.\" The number could be to the left or the right of on the number line.

If we count two units on either side of , we see that can be or .  absolut value of p-5 is 2  The distance between and is less than four units, or , or .

For example, we know that the simple equation has two solutions, and .  In fact, we can see from the graph at right that the equation has two solutions if , one solution if , and no solution if .  4 units from -2  QuickCheck 6   Use a graph of to solve the equation .  Use a graph of to solve the equation .   absolute value of 3x-6   The graph shows the graphs of and . We see that there are two points on the graph of that have , and those points have -coordinates and . We can verify algebraically that the solutions are and .   There are no points on the graph of with , so the equation has no solutions.   For more practice with absolute value functions, see Section 5.6.2 of the Toolkit.  Solving Absolute Value Equations  We can use a graphing calculator to solve the equations in .  The graph shows the graphs of and in the window We use the Trace or the intersect feature to locate the intersection points at and .  absolute value of 3x-6   Practice 6  abs(2x+7)  To solve an absolute value equation algebraically, we use the definition of absolute value.  Solve the equation algebraically.  We write the piecewise definition of . Thus, the absolute value equation is equivalent to two regular equations: or, by simplifying the second equation, Solving these two equations gives us the same solutions we found in , namely and .  In general, we have the following strategy for solving absolute value equations.  Absolute Value Equations  absolute value equations   The equation is equivalent to   Practice 7   Absolute Value Inequalities absolute value inequalities  We can also use graphs to solve absolute value inequalities. Look again at the graph of in figure (a) below.  abs-3x-6  Because of the V-shape of the graph, all points with -values less than lie between the two solutions of , that is, between and . Thus, the solutions of the inequality are as shown in figure (a).  On the other hand, to solve the inequality , we look for points on the graph with -values greater than . In figure (b), we see that these points have -values outside the interval between and . In other words, the solutions of the inequality are or .  Thus, we can solve an absolute value inequality by first solving the related equation.  Absolute Value Inequalities  absolute value inequalities compound inequality inequality compound  Suppose the solutions of the equation are and , with . Then  The solutions of are  The solutions of are   QuickCheck 8  Solve  First, we solve the equation . There are two cases: Because the inequality symbol is , the solutions of the inequality are between these two values: . In interval notation, the solutions are .

Inflation, which rose slowly until last month, is now rising rapidly.  The birthrate rose steadily until 1990 but is now beginning to fall.  The price of gasoline has fallen steadily over the past few months.   four curves    Each situation in Problems 21 26 can be modeled by a transformation of a basic function. Name the basic function and sketch a possible graph.

Match each description with the appropriate table of values and with its graph.  As a chemical pollutant pours into a lake, its concentration is a function of time. The concentration of the pollutant initially increases quite rapidly, but due to the natural mixing and self-cleansing action of the lake, the concentration levels off and stabilizes at some saturation level.  An overnight express train travels at a constant speed across the Great Plains. The train's distance from its point of origin is a function of time.  The population of a small suburb of a Florida city is a function of time. The population began increasing rather slowly, but it has continued to grow at a faster and faster rate.  The level of production at a manufacturing plant is a function of capital outlay, that is, the amount of money invested in the plant. At first, small increases in capital outlay result in large increases in production, but eventually the investors begin to experience diminishing returns on their money, so that although production continues to increase, it is at a disappointingly slow rate.                                                                                                      four increasing graphs   Table (4), Graph (C)  Table (3), Graph (B)  Table (1), Graph (D)  Table (2), Graph (A)   Four different functions are described below.

Fresh water flowing through Crystal Lake has gradually reduced the phosphate concentration to its natural level, and it is now stable.  The number of bacteria in a person during the course of an illness is a function of time. It increases rapidly at first, then decreases slowly as the patient recovers.  A squirrel drops a pine cone from the top of a California redwood. The height of the pine cone is a function of time, decreasing ever more rapidly as gravity accelerates its descent.

As the global population increases, many scientists believe it is approaching, or has already exceeded, the maximum number the Earth can sustain. This maximum number, or carrying capacity, carrying capacity depends on the finite natural resources of the planet -- water, land, air, and materials -- but also on how people use and preserve the resources. The graphs show four different ways that a growing population can approach its carrying capacity over time. (Source: Meadows, Randers, and Meadows, 2004)  models of world population limits  Match each graph to one of the scenarios described in (a)-(d), and explain your choice.  Sigmoid growth: the population levels off smoothly below the carrying capacity.  Overshoot and collapse: the population exceeds the carrying capacity with severe damage to the resource base, and is forced to decline rapidly to achieve a new balance with a reduced carrying capacity.  Continued growth: the carrying capacity is far away, or growing faster than the population.  Overshoot and oscillation: the population exceeds the carrying capacity without inflicting permanent damage, then oscillates around the limit before leveling off.

Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop, waits there until the bus arrives, and then the bus drives him to school at a constant speed.    The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in figure (a). It begins at the origin because at the instant Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when .) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrest’s walking speed.  distance from home  The first part of the graph is the same as part (a). But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in figure (b). The line has slope because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is .  The graph begins like the graph in part (b). The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in figure (c).  "

We substitute one of the data points into the formula and solve for . If we choose the point , we obtain and solving for yields . We can check that the formula is a good fit for the rest of the data points as well. Thus, we suggest the function as a model for the speed of sound.  First, we use the model to calculate the speed of sound at a temperature of Celsius. The Kelvin temperature is so we evaluate for . Thus, is approximately 343.4 meters per second.  The lightning and the thunderclap occur simultaneously, and the speed of light is so fast (about 30,000,000 meters per second) that we see the lightning flash as it occurs. So if the sound of the thunderclap takes seconds after the flash to reach us, we can use our calculated speed of sound to find our distance from the storm. The thunderstorm is 2060 meters, or about 1.3 miles, away.  "

At first, small increases in capital outlay result in large increases in production, but eventually the investors begin to experience diminishing returns on their money, so that although production continues to increase, it is at a disappointingly slow rate.                                                                                                      four increasing graphs   Table (4), Graph (C)  Table (3), Graph (B)  Table (1), Graph (D)  Table (2), Graph (A)  "

Fresh water flowing through Crystal Lake has gradually reduced the phosphate concentration to its natural level, and it is now stable.  The number of bacteria in a person during the course of an illness is a function of time. It increases rapidly at first, then decreases slowly as the patient recovers.  A squirrel drops a pine cone from the top of a California redwood. The height of the pine cone is a function of time, decreasing ever more rapidly as gravity accelerates its descent.

  "body": "As the global population increases, many scientists believe it is approaching, or has already exceeded, the maximum number the Earth can sustain. This maximum number, or carrying capacity, carrying capacity depends on the finite natural resources of the planet -- water, land, air, and materials -- but also on how people use and preserve the resources. The graphs show four different ways that a growing population can approach its carrying capacity over time. (Source: Meadows, Randers, and Meadows, 2004)  models of world population limits  Match each graph to one of the scenarios described in (a)-(d), and explain your choice.  Sigmoid growth: the population levels off smoothly below the carrying capacity.  Overshoot and collapse: the population exceeds the carrying capacity with severe damage to the resource base, and is forced to decline rapidly to achieve a new balance with a reduced carrying capacity.  Continued growth: the carrying capacity is far away, or growing faster than the population.  Overshoot and oscillation: the population exceeds the carrying capacity without inflicting permanent damage, then oscillates around the limit before leveling off. "

In symbols, we write  Absolute Value  The absolute value of is defined by  Absolute value bars act like grouping devices in the order of operations: you should complete any operations that appear inside absolute value bars before you compute the absolute value.  The maximum or minimum of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex.  Eight basic functions and their graphs are important in applications:  Two variables are directly proportional if the ratios of their corresponding values are always equal.  Direct Variation   varies directly with if where is a positive constant called the constant of variation .  Direct variation defines a linear function of the form The positive constant in the equation is just the slope of the graph.  Direct variation has the following scaling property: increasing by any factor causes to increase by the same factor.  Direct Variation with a Power   varies directly with a power of if where and are positive constants.  If the ratio is constant, then varies directly with .  Inverse Variation   varies inversely with if where is a positive constant.  Inverse Variation with a Power   varies inversely with if where and are positive constants.

  "body": "Integer Exponents exponent integer power function  You know that that a positive integer exponent tells us how many times its base occurs as a factor in an expression. For example,  What is the meaning of a negative exponent?  Negative Exponents  Study the list of powers of 2 shown in Table (a) and observe the pattern as we move up the list from bottom to top. Each time the exponent increases by 1 we multiply by another factor of 2. We can continue up the list as far as we like.   a.  If we move back down the list, we divide by 2 at each step, until we get to the bottom of the list, . What if we continue the list in the same way, dividing by 2 each time we decrease the exponent? The results are shown in Table (b).  As we continue to divide by 2, we generate fractions whose denominators are powers of 2. In particular,  table of integer exponents  b.   Based on these observations, we make the following definitions.  Definition of Negative and Zero Exponents exponent negative exponent zero negative and zero exponents negative exponents     These definitions tell us that if the base is not zero, then any number raised to the zero power is , and that a negative exponent denotes a reciprocal.       A negative exponent does not mean that the power is negative! For example,  In b, note that The exponent, , applies only to the base , not to .  exponent negative  QuickCheck 1  Practice 1  For more practice using negative exponents, see Section 6.1.1 of the Toolkit.  In the next Example, we see how to evaluate expressions that contain negative exponents and how to solve equations involving negative exponents.  The body mass index, or BMI, is one measure of a person’s physical fitness. Your body mass index is defined by where is your weight in kilograms and is your height in meters. The World Health Organization classifies a person as obese if his or her BMI is 25 or higher.  Calculate the BMI for a woman who is 1.625 meters (64 inches) tall and weighs 54 kilograms (120 pounds).  For a fixed weight, how does BMI vary with height?  The world’s heaviest athlete is the amateur sumo wrestler Emanuel Yarbrough, who weighs 319 kg (704 pounds). What height would Yarbrough have to be to have a BMI under 25?    We evaluate the formula to find  , so BMI varies inversely with the square of height. That is, for a fixed weight, BMI decreases as height increases.  To find the height that gives a BMI of , we solve the equation . Note that the variable appears in the denominator of a fraction, so we begin by clearing the denominator—in this case we multiply both sides of the equation by . To have a BMI under 25, Yarbrough would have to be over 3.75 meters, or 11 feet 8 inches tall. (In fact, he is 6 feet 8 inches tall.)   Practice 2   Power Functions  The functions that describe direct and inverse variation are part of a larger family of functions called power functions .  Power Function power function  A function of the form where and are nonzero constants, is called a power function power function .  Examples of power functions are In addition, the basic functions which we studied in can be written as Their graphs are shown below. Note that power functions with negative exponents are undefined at zero.  graphs of the two basic reciprocal functions  Which of the following are power functions?        This is not a power function, because of the addition of the constant term.  We can write , so is a power function.  This is not a power function, but it can be treated as the sum of two power functions, because .   QuickCheck 2  Practice 3  Most applications are concerned with positive variables only, so many models use only the portion of the graph in the first quadrant.  The intensity of the radiation from our Sun varies inversely with distance.   Use a negative exponent to write a formula for the intensity as a function of .

Find the constant of proportionality in the formula for .  Graph .  Earth is 1 AU from the Sun. What is the intensity of the Sun's radiation at the surface of the Earth?  The surface of Jupiter receives 50.63 watts per square meter of the Sun's radiation. How far is Jupiter from the Sun?   If we use for the constant of proportionality, then . Rewriting this equation with a negative exponent gives .  We substitute and to obtain Thus, .  We evaluate the function for several values of , and use technology to obtain the graph shown.  triangle  We substitute into the formula to obtain Earth receives 1370 watts\/m of solar radiation.  We substitute into the formula, and solve for . Jupiter is 5.202 AU from the Sun, or about 484 million miles.   The function is an example of an inverse square law inverse square law , because varies inversely with the square of . Such laws are fairly common in physics and its applications, because gravitational and other forces behave in this way. Here is another example of an inverse square law.  Practice 4   Working with Negative Exponents exponent negative  The laws of exponents apply to all integer exponents, positive negative, and zero. When we allow negative exponents, we only need one version of the rule for computing quotients of powers, namely For example, by applying this new version of the law we find which is consistent with our previous version of the rule,  For reference, we restate the laws of exponents below. The laws are valid for all integer exponents and , and for .  Laws of Exponents  laws of exponents exponent laws of              You can check that each of the calculations in is shorter when we use negative exponents instead of converting the expressions into algebraic fractions.  Practice 5  To review using the laws of exponents, see Section 6.1.2 of the Toolkit.  The laws of exponents do not apply to sums or differences of powers. We can add or subtract like terms, that is, powers with the same exponent. For example, but we cannot combine terms with different exponents into a single term. Thus, for example,   In the opening table we saw that , and in fact as long as . Now we can see that this definition is consistent with the laws of exponents.

Review of Scientific Notation scientific notation  Scientists and engineers regularly encounter very large numbers such as, (the mass of the earth in kilograms) and very small numbers such as (the mass of a hydrogen atom in grams) in their work. These numbers are easier to use when expressed in scientific notation .  To Write a Number in Scientific Notation scientific notation   Locate the decimal point so that there is exactly one nonzero digit to its left.  Count the number of places you moved the decimal point: this determines the power of 10.  If the original number is greater than 10, the exponent is positive.  If the original number is less than 1, the exponent is negative.  Write each number in scientific notation.          For more help practicec with scientific notation, see Section 6.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6  Your calculator displays numbers in scientific notation if they are too large or too small to fit in the display screen. Try squaring the number on your calculator. Enter and the calculator will display the result as This is how the calculator displays the number . Notice that the power is displayed as E 16.  To enter a number in scientific form, we use the key labeled EE , possibly accessed by pressing 2nd  , . For example, to enter we enter the keying sequence  EE  (-)   In 2019, the average American ate 98.6 kilograms of meat. It takes about 16 kilograms of grain to produce one kilogram of meat, and advanced farming techniques can produce about 6000 kilograms of grain on each hectare of arable land. (A hectare is 10,000 square meters, or just under two and a half acres.)  Now, the total land area of the Earth is about 13 billion hectares, but only about 11% of that land is arable. Is it possible for each of the 7.8 billion people on Earth to eat as much meat as Americans do?  First we'll compute the amount of meat necessary to feed every person on earth 110 kilograms per year. In scientific notation, the population of Earth is people. Next we'll compute the amount of grain needed to produce that much meat. Next we'll see how many hectares of land are needed to produce that much grain. Finally, we'll compute the amount of land on Earth suitable for grain production. The amount of arable land on Earth is less than the amount needed to produce that much grain. Thus, even if we use every hectare of arable land to produce grain for livestock, we won't have enough to provide every person on Earth with 98.6 kilograms of meat per year.     Problem Set 6.1  Warm Up  For Problems 1 and 2, simplify if possible.           For Problems 3 6, use the laws of exponents to simplilfy.                    Skills Practice  For Problems 7 11, simplify. Write your answers as integers or common fractions; do not use a calculator!                                                            For Problems 12 and 13, write without negative exponents and simplify.                 Write each expression as a power function using negative exponents.        For Problems 15 17, solve.

If you increase your speed by 50%, by what factor does the power requirement increase?    mph  3.375   Poiseuille's law for the flow of liquid through a tube can be used to describe blood flow through an artery. The rate of flow, , in liters per minute is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, , divided by the length, , of the artery.  Write a formula for the rate of flow as a power function of radius.  If the radius and length of the artery are measured in centimeters, then the constant of variation, , is determined by blood pressure and viscosity. If a certain artery is 20 centimeters long, what should its radius be in order to allow a blood flow of 5 liters per minute?   The f-stop setting on a camera regulates the size of the aperture and thus the amount of light entering the camera. The f-stop is inversely proportional to the diameter, , of the aperture.  Use the data and the graph to find the constant of proportionality and write as a power function of . Values of have been rounded to one decimal place.                 power function  Why are the f-stop settings labeled with the values given in the table?  As you stop down the aperture from one f-value to the next, by what factor does increase?   The are of the aperture decreases by a factor of 0.5 at each -stop.   The lifetime of a star is roughly inversely proportional to the cube of its mass. Our Sun, which has a mass of one solar mass, will last for approximately 10 billion years.  Write a power function for the lifetime, , of a star in terms of its mass, .  Sketch a graph of the function using units of solar mass on the horizontal axis.  How long will a star live that is 10 times as massive as the Sun last?  One solar mass is about kilograms. Rewrite your formula for with the units of mass in kilograms.

  "body": "The body mass index, or BMI, is one measure of a person’s physical fitness. Your body mass index is defined by where is your weight in kilograms and is your height in meters. The World Health Organization classifies a person as obese if his or her BMI is 25 or higher.  Calculate the BMI for a woman who is 1.625 meters (64 inches) tall and weighs 54 kilograms (120 pounds).  For a fixed weight, how does BMI vary with height?  The world’s heaviest athlete is the amateur sumo wrestler Emanuel Yarbrough, who weighs 319 kg (704 pounds). What height would Yarbrough have to be to have a BMI under 25?    We evaluate the formula to find  , so BMI varies inversely with the square of height. That is, for a fixed weight, BMI decreases as height increases.  To find the height that gives a BMI of , we solve the equation . Note that the variable appears in the denominator of a fraction, so we begin by clearing the denominator—in this case we multiply both sides of the equation by . To have a BMI under 25, Yarbrough would have to be over 3.75 meters, or 11 feet 8 inches tall. (In fact, he is 6 feet 8 inches tall.)  "

It takes about 16 kilograms of grain to produce one kilogram of meat, and advanced farming techniques can produce about 6000 kilograms of grain on each hectare of arable land. (A hectare is 10,000 square meters, or just under two and a half acres.)  Now, the total land area of the Earth is about 13 billion hectares, but only about 11% of that land is arable. Is it possible for each of the 7.8 billion people on Earth to eat as much meat as Americans do?  First we'll compute the amount of meat necessary to feed every person on earth 110 kilograms per year. In scientific notation, the population of Earth is people. Next we'll compute the amount of grain needed to produce that much meat. Next we'll see how many hectares of land are needed to produce that much grain. Finally, we'll compute the amount of land on Earth suitable for grain production. The amount of arable land on Earth is less than the amount needed to produce that much grain.

  "body": "Roots and Radicals  In the previous section we saw that inverse variation can be expressed as a power function by using negative integer exponents. For example, the function can also be written as . Using negative exponents can simplify many calculations that would otherwise involve algebraic fractions.  But is there some meaning to exponents that are fractions, such as or ? For example, do expressions such as or have some familiar interpretation? We'll see that fractional exponents can denote square roots and other radicals.  Roots n root root n  Recall that is a square root of if , and is a cube root of if . For example, is a square root of because , and is a cube root of because .  In a similar way, we can define the fourth, fifth, or sixth root of a number. For instance, the fourth root of is the number because .  th Roots  is called an  th root of if .  We use the symbol to denote the th root of . An expression of the form is called a radical radical , is called the radicand radicand , and is called the index of the radical index (of a radical) .    because  because  because  because  because   To review the definition of root, see Section 6.2.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1   Exponential Notation for Radicals exponential notation for radicals exponent rational exponent fractional radical exponential notation  A convenient notation for radicals uses fractional exponents. Consider the expression . What meaning can we attach to an exponent that is a fraction? Recall that when we raise a power to a power, we multiply the exponents together: Therefore, if we square the number , we get Thus, is a number whose square is . But this means that is a square root of , or  QuickCheck 1  Remember that actually has two square roots, namely and . But the symbol represents only the positive square root, so that . The same is true for the exponent : any nonnegative number raised to the power is equal to the positive square root of the number, or     is not a real number.    Practice 2  The same reasoning works for roots with any index index (of a radical) . For instance, is the cube root of , because Thus, we make the following definition for fractional exponents.  Exponential Notation for Radicals exponent rational exponent fractional radical exponential notation index (of a radical)  For any integer and for ,        Note that An exponent of denotes the square root of its base, and an exponent of denotes the cube root of its base.  Practice 3  Of course, we can use decimal fractions for exponents as well. For example,      Practice 4  QuickCheck 2   Irrational Numbers  What about th roots such as and that cannot be evaluated easily? These are examples of irrational numbers irrational numbers . An irrational number is one that cannot be expressed as a quotient of two integers.  It is not possible to write down an exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number, but we can find an approximation to as many decimal places as we like. We can use a calculator to obtain decimal approximations for irrational numbers. For example, you can verify that  The following keying sequence for evaluating the irrational number is incorrect:  7 1 5 ENTER  You can check that this sequence calculates , instead of . Recall that according to the order of operations, powers are computed before multiplications or divisions. We must enclose the exponent in parentheses and enter  7 ( 1 5 ) ENTER   Or, because , we can enter  7 0.2 ENTER  To review irrational numbers, see Section 6.2.2 of the Toolkit.   Working with Fractional Exponents exponent rational exponent fractional  Fractional exponents simplify many calculations involving radicals. It will be useful for you to convert easily between exponential and radical notation.  Convert each radical to exponential notation.     In part (b) of the Example above, the parentheses around must not be omitted. The expression means .  Remember that a negative exponent denotes a reciprocal.  Practice 5  Convert each power to radical notation.       In , note that the exponent applies only to , not to . Compare with    For more examples of simplifying expressions, see Section 6.2.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6  QuickCheck 3   Using Fractional Exponents to Solve Equations exponent rational exponent fractional  We know that raising to powers and taking roots are inverse operations, that is, each operation undoes the effects of the other. This relationship is especially easy to see when the root is denoted by a fractional exponent. For example, to solve the equation we would take the fifth root of each side. But instead of using radical notation, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power : Notice again that , so Thus, to solve an equation involving a power function , we first isolate the power, then raise both sides to the exponent .  For astronomers, the mass of a star is its most important property, but it is also the most difficult to measure directly. For many stars, their luminosity, or brightness, varies roughly as the fourth power of the mass.  Our Sun has luminosity watts and mass kilograms. Because the numbers involved are so large, astronomers often use these solar constants as units of measure: The luminosity of the Sun is solar luminosity, and its mass is solar mass. Write a power function for the luminosity, , of a star in terms of its mass, , using units of solar mass and solar luminosity.  The star Sirius is 23 times brighter than the Sun, so its luminosity is 23 solar luminosities. Estimate the mass of Sirius in units of solar mass.    Because varies as the fourth power of , we have Substituting the values of and for the Sun (namely, and ), we find so and .  We substitute the luminosity of Sirius, , to get To solve the equation for , we raise both sides to the power. The mass of Sirius is about 2.2 solar masses, or about 2.2 times the mass of the Sun.   QuickCheck 4   Power Functions power function  The size of a diamond is usually given by its weight in carats. The diameter, , of a diamond cut in a traditional round style is then a power function of its weight, given by   A diamond weighing one-quarter carat has diameter about 4.05 millimeters. Find the constant of proportionality, , and write a formula for as a function of .  Complete the table with the diameters of diamonds of various weights.

We substitute and into the equation and solve for . Rounded to tenths, , and .  We evaluate the function for each of the weights given in the table. The diameters are rounded to tenths of a millimeter.    (carats)            (mm)            We plot the points from the table and draw a smooth curve to obtain the graph shown.  diameter vs carats   We evaluate the function for to obtain According to our formula, the Hope Diamond is about 22.85 millimeters in diameter.   Of course, power functions can be expressed using any of the notations we have discussed. For example, the function in the Example above can be written as  Practice 8  power function    Solving Radical Equations  A radical equation radical equation equation radical radical equation is one in which the variable appears under a square root or other radical. The radical may be denoted by a fractional exponent. For example, the equation is a radical equation because . To solve the equation, we first isolate the power to get Then we raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal of , or .  When a car brakes suddenly, its speed can be estimated from the length of the skid marks it leaves on the pavement. A formula for the car’s speed, in miles per hour, is where the length of the skid marks, , is given in feet.  If a car leaves skid marks 80 feet long, how fast was the car traveling when the driver applied the brakes?  How far will a car skid if its driver applies the brakes while traveling 80 miles per hour?    To find the velocity of the car, we evaluate the function for . The car was traveling at approximately 44 miles per hour.  We would like to find the value of when the value of is known. We substitute into the formula and solve the equation Because appears to the power , we first square both sides of the equation to get You can check that this value for works in the original equation. Thus, the car will skid approximately 267 feet. A graph of the function is shown below, along with the points corresponding to the values in parts (a) and (b).  velocity vs braking distance   Thus, we can solve an equation where one side is an th root of by raising both sides of the equation to the th power. We must be careful when raising both sides of an equation to an even power, since extraneous solutions may be introduced. However, because most applications of power functions deal with positive numbers only, they do not usually involve extraneous solutions. extraneous solution  QuickCheck 5  Practice 9   Roots of Negative Numbers root of negative numbers  You already know that is not a real number, because there is no real number whose square is . Similarly, is not a real number, because there is no real number for which . (Both of these radicals represent complex numbers complex number .) In general, we cannot find an even root (square root, fourth root, and so on) of a negative number.  On the other hand, every positive number has two even roots that are real numbers. For example, both and are square roots of . The symbol refers only to the positive, or principal root principal root root principal root positive root principal root principal root root , of . If we want to refer to the negative square root of , we must write . Similarly, both and are fourth roots of , because and . However, the symbol refers to the principal, or positive, fourth root only. Thus,  Things are simpler for odd roots (cube roots, fifth roots, and so on). Every real number, whether positive, negative, or zero, has exactly one real-valued odd root. For example,  Here is a summary of our discussion.  Roots of Real Numbers root of real numbers   Every positive number has two real-valued roots, one positive and one negative, if the index is even.  A negative number has no real-valued root if the index is even.  Every real number, positive, negative, or zero, has exactly one real-valued root if the index is odd.    is not a real number.    is not a real number.   The same principles apply to powers with fractional exponents. Thus but is not a real number.

  "body": "For astronomers, the mass of a star is its most important property, but it is also the most difficult to measure directly. For many stars, their luminosity, or brightness, varies roughly as the fourth power of the mass.  Our Sun has luminosity watts and mass kilograms. Because the numbers involved are so large, astronomers often use these solar constants as units of measure: The luminosity of the Sun is solar luminosity, and its mass is solar mass. Write a power function for the luminosity, , of a star in terms of its mass, , using units of solar mass and solar luminosity.  The star Sirius is 23 times brighter than the Sun, so its luminosity is 23 solar luminosities. Estimate the mass of Sirius in units of solar mass.    Because varies as the fourth power of , we have Substituting the values of and for the Sun (namely, and ), we find so and .  We substitute the luminosity of Sirius, , to get To solve the equation for , we raise both sides to the power. The mass of Sirius is about 2.2 solar masses, or about 2.2 times the mass of the Sun.  "

  "body": "Rational Exponents  Powers of the Form exponent fractional exponent rational  In the last section, we considered powers of the form , such as and , and saw that is equivalent to the root . What about other fractional exponents? What meaning can we attach to a power of the form ?  Consider the power . Notice that the exponent , and thus by the third law of exponents, we can write In other words, we can compute by first taking the square root of and then cubing the result. For example,  QuickCheck 1  A fractional exponent represents a power and a root. The denominator of the exponent is the root, and the numerator of the exponent is the power. We will define fractional exponents only when the base is a positive number.  Rational Exponents rational exponents a rational exponents exponent rational exponent fractional    To compute , we can compute the root first, or the power, whichever is easier. For example, or        You can verify all the calculations in on your calculator. For example, to evaluate , key in  81 ( 3 4 ) ENTER  or simply  81 0.75 ENTER  When computing on a calculator, do not forget the parentheses around the exponent, . The keying sequence      ENTER gives us the value of , or . The parentheses tell the calculator to include all of the quotient in the exponent, not just the 3.   Practice 1   Power Functions power function  Perhaps the single most useful piece of information a scientist can have about an animal is its metabolic rate. The metabolic rate is the amount of energy the animal uses per unit of time for its usual activities, including locomotion, growth, and reproduction.  The basal metabolic rate, or BMR, sometimes called the resting metabolic rate, is the minimum amount of energy the animal can expend in order to survive.  In the next example we study Kleiber's Rule, which uses a fractional exponent in decimal form.  To review converting between common fractions and decimals, see Section 6.3.2 of the Toolkit.  A revised form of Kleiber's Rule Kleiber's Rule states that the basal metabolic rate for many groups of animals is given by where is the mass of the animal in kilograms and the BMR is measured in kilocalories per day.  Calculate the BMR for various animals whose masses are given in the table.    Animal  Bat  Squirrel  Raccoon  Lynx  Human  Moose  Rhinoceros   Weight (kg)          BMR (kcal\/day)          Sketch a graph of Kleiber’s rule for .  Do larger species eat more or less, relative to their body mass, than smaller ones?    We evaluate the function for the values of given. For example, to calculate the BMR of a bat, we compute A bat expends, and hence must consume, at least 12 kilocalories per day. We evaluate the function to complete the rest of the table. The values of BMR are rounded to the nearest whole number.    Animal  Bat  Squirrel  Raccoon  Lynx  Human  Moose  Rhinoceros   Weight (kg)          BMR (kcal\/day)          We plot the data from the table to obtain the graph below.  BMR vs mass  If energy consumption were proportional to body weight, the graph would be a straight line. But this graph is concave down, or bends downward. Larger species eat less than smaller ones, relative to their body weight. For example, a moose weighs 600 times as much as a squirrel, but its energy requirement is only 121 times the squirrel's.   QuickCheck 2  Practice 2  power function   Radical Notation  Because , we can write any power with a fractional exponent in radical form as follows.  Rational Exponents and Radicals rational exponents exponent rational exponent fractional radical         Practice 3  Usually, we will want to convert from radical notation to fractional exponents, because exponential notation is easier to use.        Practice 4  QuickCheck 3   Operations with Rational Exponents  Powers with rational exponents—positive, negative, or zero—obey the laws of exponents, which we discussed in . You may want to review those laws before studying the following examples.  Use the laws of ecponents to simplify each expression.        To review operations on fractions, see Section 6.3.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 5   Solving Equations  According to the third law of exponents, when we raise a power to another power, we multiply the exponents together. In particular, if the two exponents are reciprocals, then their product is . For example, This observation can help us to solve equations involving fractional exponents. For instance, to solve the equation we raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal power, . This gives us The solution is .  Solve  We raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal power, .  For more practice solving equartionss, see Section 6.3.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6  QuickCheck 4    Inflating a Balloon  If you blow air into a balloon, what do you think will happen to the air pressure inside the balloon as it expands? Here is what two physics books have to say:  “The greater the pressure inside, the greater the balloon’s volume.” Jay Boleman, Physics, a Window on Our World  “Contrary to the process of blowing up a toy balloon, the pressure required to force air into a bubble decreases with bubble size.” Francis Sears, Mechanics, Heat, and Sound   On the basis of these two quotations and your own intuition, sketch a graph of pressure as a function of the diameter of the balloon. Describe your graph: Is it increasing or decreasing? Is it concave up (bending upward) or concave down (bending downward)?  Two high school students, April Leonardo and Tolu Noah, decided to see for themselves how the pressure inside a balloon changes as the balloon expands. Using a column of water to measure pressure, they collected the following data while blowing up a balloon. Graph their data on the grid below.     Diameter (cm)  Pressure (cm O)                                                         grid  Describe the graph of April and Tolu’s data. Does the graph confirm the predictions of the physics books?  As the diameter of the balloon increases from 5 cm to 20 cm, the pressure inside decreases. Can we find a function that describes this portion of the graph? Here is some information:  Pressure is the force per unit area exerted by the balloon on the air inside, or .  The balloon is spherical, so its surface area, , is given by surface area of a sphere .  Because the force increases as the balloon expands, we will try a power function of the form , where and are constants, to see if it fits the data. Combine the three equations, , and , to express as a power function of .  Graph the function on the same grid with the data. Do the data support the hypothesis that is a power function of ?  What is the value of the exponent in ?     Problem Set 6.3  Warm Up  Combining powers and roots  Start with 8, square it, and then take the cube root of the result.

In the 1970s, Jared Diamond studied the number of bird species on small islands near New Guinea. He found that larger islands support a larger number of different species, according to the formula where is the number of species on an island of area square kilometers. (Source: Chapman and Reiss, 1992)  Fill in the table.                Graph the function on your calculator for .  How many species of birds would you expect to find on Manus Island, with an area of 2100 square kilometers? On Lavongai, whose area is 1140 square kilometers?

Extreme temperatures create difficult living conditions, so the diversity of wildlife decreases as the annual temperature range increases. Along the west coast of North America, the number of species of mammals, , is approximately related to the temperature range, , (in degrees Celsius) by the function (Source: Chapman and Reiss, 1992)  Graph the function for temperature ranges up to C.  How many species would you expect to find in a region where the temperature range is C? Label the corresponding point on your graph.  If 50 different species are found in a certain region, what temperature range would you expect the region to experience? Label the corresponding point on your graph.  Evaluate the function to find , , , and . What do these values represent? Calculate the change in the number of species as the temperature range increases from C to C and from C to C. Which increase results in a greater decrease in diversity? Explain your answer in terms of slopes on your graph.

Using the allometric equation above, calculate the ratio of the brain mass of a dolphin to that of a human.  A good-sized brown bear weighs about 280 kilograms, twice the weight of a dolphin. Calculate the ratio of the brain mass of a brown bear to that of a dolphin.  Use a ratio to compare the heartbeat frequencies of a dolphin and a human, and those of a brown bear and a dolphin.  1.62  1.62  0.84; 0.84  A bicycle ergometer is used to measure the amount of power generated by a cyclist.

What power output does the equation predict for 40 seconds?  The athlete maintained 300 watts of power for 10 minutes. How long does the equation predict that power output can be maintained?  In 1979 a remarkable pedal-powered aircraft called the Gossamer Albatross was successfully flown across the English Channel. The flight took 3 hours. According to the equation, what level of power can be maintained for 3 hours?  The Gossamer Albatross needed 250 watts of power to keep it airborne. For how long can 250 watts be maintained, according to the equation?  Birds’ eggs typically lose 10%–20% of their mass during incubation. The embryo metabolizes lipid during growth, and this process releases water vapor through the porous shell. The incubation time for birds’ eggs is a function of the mass of the egg and has been experimentally determined as where is measured in grams and in days. (Source: Burton, 1998)  Calculate the incubation time (to the nearest day) for the wren, whose eggs weigh about 2.5 grams, and the greylag goose, whose eggs weigh 46 grams.  The rate of water loss from the egg is also a function of its mass and appears to follow the rule Combine the functions and to calculate the fraction of the initial egg mass that is lost during the entire incubation period.  Explain why your result shows that most eggs lose about 18% of their mass during incubation.   15 days, 28 days   is close to 1  The incubation time for birds’ eggs is given by where is measured in grams and in days. (See Problem 41.) Before hatching, the eggs take in oxygen at the rate of in milliliters per day. (Source: Burton, 1998)  Combine the functions and to calculate the total amount of oxygen taken in by the egg during its incubation.  Use your result from part (a) to explain why total oxygen consumption per unit mass is approximately inversely proportional to incubation time. (Oxygen consumption is a reliable indicator of metabolic rate, and it is reasonable that incubation time should be inversely proportional to metabolic rate.)  Predict the oxygen consumption per gram of a herring gull’s eggs, given that their incubation time is 26 days. (The actual value is 11 milliliters per day.)

  "body": "Working with Radicals  Sometimes radical notation is more convenient to use than exponents. In these cases, we usually simplify radical expressions algebraically before using a calculator to obtain decimal approximations.  Properties of Radicals  Because , we can use the laws of exponents to derive two important properties that are useful in working with radicals.  Product Rule for Radicals product rule for radicals    Quotient Rule for Radicals quotient rule for radicals radical quotient rule for    As examples, you can verify that  In general, it is not true that is equivalent to , or that is equivalent to .  For example, you can check that  Which of the following are true?   Is  Is  Is  Is   The statements in (b) and (d) are true, and both are examples of the first property of radicals .  Statements (a) and (c) are false.  For more on the properties of radicals, see Section 6.4.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 1   Simplifying Radicals radical simpifying  Each time we use a calculator to approximate a radical, we lose accuracy, and in the course of a long calculation, the error accumulates. To avoid this problem, we simplify radicals by factoring out any perfect powers from the radicand.  Simplify  We look for perfect cubes that divide evenly into . The easiest way to do this is to try the perfect cubes in order: and so on, until we find one that is a factor. For this example, we find that . Applying the Product Rule, we write This expression is considered simpler than the original radical because the new radicand, , is smaller than the original, .  For more on factoring out perfect powers, see Section 6.4.1 of the Toolkit.  Finding a decimal approximation for a radical is not the same as simplifying the radical. In the Example above, we can use a calculator to find but is not the exact value for .  In long calculations, too much error may be introduced by approximating each radical. However, is equal to , so their values are exactly the same. We can replace one expression by the other without losing accuracy.  Practice 1  We can also simplify radicals containing variables. If the exponent on the variable is a multiple of the index, we can extract the variable from the radical. For instance, (You can verify this by noting that .)  Do not confuse with . Compare the two radicals:  Simplify   Because the exponent on the variable, 11, is not a multiple of the index, 3, we factor out the highest power that is a multiple.  Practice 2  To simplify a root of a monomial, we factor the coefficient and each power of a variable separately.  Simplify each radical.       The index of the radical is , so we look for perfect square factors of . The factor is a perfect square, and has an exponent divisible by . Thus,  The index of the radical is , so we look for perfect cube factors of . The factor is a perfect cube, and and have exponents divisible by . Thus,   For more help on simplifying radicals, see Section 6.4.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3  It is worth stating again that the Product Rule applies only to products under the radical, not to sums or differences. For example, and   QuickCheck 2   Sums and Differences of Radicals radical sums and differences of  How can we add or subtract radicals? Keep in mind that, in general, We cannot add or subtract expressions that occur under a radical. For example, you can check that However, if two roots have the same index and identical radicands, they are said to be like radicals like radical radical like radicals . We can add or subtract like radicals in the same way that we add or subtract like terms, namely by adding or subtracting their coefficients. For example, we know that where is a variable that can stand for any real number. In particular, if , we have So we may add like radicals by adding their coefficients. The same idea applies to subtraction.  Like Radicals  To add or subtract like radicals, we add or subtract their coefficients. We do not change the index or the radicand.       In a, . Only the coefficients are added; the radicand does not change.  Sums of radicals with different radicands or different indices cannot be combined. Thus, None of the expressions above can be simplified.   Practice 4  QuickCheck 3  Sometimes we must simplify the roots in a sum or difference before we can recognize like radicals.  Simplify  We simplify each cube root by factoring perfect cubes from the radicals.   Practice 5   Products and Quotients of Radicals  Because of the Product and Quotient Rules, we can multiply or divide radicals of the same index. These rules tell us that for products and quotients, the radicands do not have to be the same; only the indices must match.  Simplify.      We apply the Product Rule to write the product as a single radical, then simplify.  We apply the Quotient Rule to write the quotient as a single radical, then reduce the fraction under the radical.   Practice 6  For products involving binomials, we apply the distributive law.  Expand each product.     We multiply each term within the parentheses by .  We use the \"FOIL\" method to expand the product.   In part (a) of the Example above, observe that We multiply together any expressions outside the radical, and apply the product rule to expressions under the radical.  Practice 7  QuickCheck 4   Rationalizing the Denominator radical rationalizing the denominator rationalizing the denominator rationalizing the denominator radical  It is easier to work with radicals if there are no roots in the denominators of fractions. We can use the fundamental principle of fractions to remove radicals from the denominator. This process is called rationalizing the denominator rationalizing the denominator . For square roots, we multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the radical in the denominator.  Rationalize the denominator of each fraction.      First, we apply the Quotient Rule to write the radical as a quotient.   It is always best to simplify the denominator before rationalizing. Now we can see that we should multiply numerator and denominator by — not !   Practice 8  If the denominator of a fraction is a binomial binomial denominator with radical in which one or both terms is a radical, we can use a special building factor to rationalize it. First, recall that In particular, then, The product contains no radicals. Each of the two factors and is said to be the conjugate conjugate of the other.  Now consider a fraction of the form If we multiply the numerator and denominator of this fraction by the conjugate of the denominator, we get The denominator of the fraction no longer contains any radicals—it has been rationalized.  Rationalize the denominator: .   We multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, .  For more examples of rationalizing the denominator, see Section 6.4.4 of the Toolkit.  Practice 9  QuickCheck 5    Problem Set 6.4  Warm Up  Each question in Problems 1 4 is followed by three examples. Use your calculator to decide if the examples are true or false, then circle the correct answer.  Is ? Yes or No    No  Is ? Yes or No     Is ? Yes or No    Yes  Is ?

We solve simple radical equations by raising both sides to the appropriate power. For example, to solve the equation we square both sides to find You can check that is the solution for this equation.  Solve  We first divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate the radical. Next, we cube both sides of the equation.   The solution is 36. We can also solve the equation graphically by graphing , as shown in the figure. The point lies on the graph, so is the solution of the equation   transformed cube root function    For more examples of solving radical equations, see Section 6.5.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1   Extraneous Solutions  Whenever we raise both sides of an equation to an even power, it is possible to introduce false or extraneous solutions extraneous solution . For example, the equation has no solution, because is never a negative number. However, if we try to solve the equation by squaring both sides, we find You can check that is not a solution to the original equation, , because does not equal .  Raising both sides of an equation to an odd power does not introduce extraneous solutions. However, if we raise both sides to an even power, we should check each solution in the original equation.  QuickCheck 1  Solve the equation  First, we isolate the radical expression on one side of the equation. (This will make it easier to square both sides.)  Check  Does ?    Does ?    The apparent solution is extraneous. The only solution to the original equation is . We can verify the solution by graphing the equations   as shown at right. The graphs intersect in only one point, , so there is only one solution, .  graphs of both sides of radical equation  When we square both sides of an equation, it is not correct to square each term of the equation separately. Thus, in , the original equation is not equivalent to This is because . Instead, we must square the entire left side of the equation as a binomial, like this, or we may proceed as shown in .  Practice 2  QuickCheck 2   Solving Formulas  We can also solve formulas involving radicals for one variable in terms of the others.  Solve the formula for .  Because the variable we want is under a square root, we square both sides of the equation, to get   Practice 3   Equations with More than One Radical equation with more than one radical  Sometimes we need to square both sides of an equation more than once in order to eliminate all the radicals.  Solve .   First, we isolate the more complicated radical on one side of the equation. (This will make it easier to square both sides.) We subtract from both sides to get Now we square each side to remove one radical. Be careful when squaring the binomial .  We collect like terms, and isolate the radical on one side of the equation. Finally, we square both sides again to obtain  Check Does ?    For more help on squaring binomials, see Section 6.5.2 of the Toolkit.  Recall that we cannot solve a radical equation by squaring each term separately. So it is incorrect to begin by writing We must square the entire expression on each side of the equal sign as one piece.  Practice 4   Simplifying  We have seen that raising to a power is the inverse operation for extracting roots, so that For example, What if the power and root operations occur in the opposite order? Is it always true that ?  First, consider the case where the index is an odd number. For example, Because every real number has exactly one th root if is odd, we see that, However, if is even, then is positive, regardless of whether itself is positive or negative, and hence is positive also. For example, if , then In this case, does not equal , because is negative but is positive. We must be careful when taking even roots of powers.

Definition of Negative and Zero Exponents   A negative exponent denotes a reciprocal, as long as the base is not zero. A negative exponent does not mean that the power is negative.  Power Function  A function of the form where and are nonzero constants, is called a power function power function .  Laws of Exponents       The laws of exponents are used to simplify products and quotients of powers, not for sums or differences of powers. We can combine (add or subtract) like terms, but we cannot combine terms with different exponents into a single term.  To Write a Number in Scientific Notation  Locate the decimal point so that there is exactly one nonzero digit to its left.  Count the number of places you moved the decimal point: this determines the power of 10.  If the original number is greater than 10, the exponent is positive.  If the original number is less than 1, the exponent is negative.   th Roots  is called an  th root of if .  Exponential Notation for Radicals  For any integer and for ,   It is not possible to write down an exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number, but we can find an approximation to as many decimal places as we like.  To solve an equation involving , we first isolate the power, then raise both sides to the exponent .  We can solve an equation where one side is an th root of by raising both sides of the equation to the th power. We must be careful when raising both sides of an equation to an even power, as extraneous solutions may be introduced.  Roots of Real Numbers  Every positive number has two real-valued roots, one positive and one negative, if the index is even.  A negative number has no real-valued root if the index is even.  Every real number, positive, negative, or zero, has exactly one real-valued root if the index is odd.   A fractional exponent represents a power and a root. The denominator of the exponent is the root, and the numerator of the exponent is the power. We will define fractional powers only when the base is a positive number.  Direct variation has the following scaling property: increasing by any factor causes to increase by the same factor.  Rational Exponents   Rational Exponents and Radicals   To solve an equation with a fractional exponent we first isolate the power. Then we raise both sides to the reciprocal of the exponent.  Product Rule for Radicals     Quotient Rule for Radicals   In general, it is not true that is equivalent to , or that is equivalent to .  We simplify radicals by factoring out any perfect powers from the radicand.  We can add or subtract like radicals in the same way that we add or subtract like terms, by adding or subtracting their coefficients.  We can use the fundamental principle of fractions to remove radicals from the denominator. This process is called rationalizing the denominator.  Whenever we raise both sides of an equation to an even power, it is possible to introduce false or extraneous solutions.  Roots of Powers      Chapter 6 Review Problems  For Problems 1 6, write without negative exponents and simplify.

Shipbuilders find that the average cost of producing a ship decreases as more of those ships are produced. This relationship is called the experience curve, and is given by the equation where is the average cost per ship in millions of dollars and is the number of ships produced.

  "body": "Exponential Growth and Decay  Introduction  While completing the next Investigation, keep in mind that using an exponent, or raising to a power, means repeated multiplication by the base.  Population Growth  In a laboratory experiment, researchers establish a colony of bacteria and monitor its growth. The colony triples in population every day.                                             Fill in the table showing the population of bacteria days later.  Plot the data points from the table and connect them with a smooth curve.  Write a function that gives the population of the colony at any time , in days. Hint: Express the values you calculated in part (1) using powers of . What connection do you see between the value of and the exponent on ?  Graph your function from part (3) using technology. (Use the table to choose an appropriate window.) The graph should resemble your hand-drawn graph from part (2).  Evaluate your function to find the number of bacteria present after 8 days. How many bacteria are present after 36 hours (1.5 days)?   grid for graph of bacteria population    The function in describes exponential growth . During each time interval of a fixed length, the population is multiplied by a certain constant amount. In this case, the bacteria population grows by a factor of 3 every day.  table of bacteria population  For this reason, we say that 3 is the growth factor growth factor exponential growth growth factor for the function.   Growth Factors  Researchers often use cell lines from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study protein interactions related to cancer and other diseases. From 60% to 70% of human disease genes are found in Drosophila cells, and gene discoveries in the flies have led to parallel studies in vertebrates.  One milliliter of culture contains about 1 million Drosophila cells, and the population doubles every 24 hours. The table shows the population, , of Drosophila cells, in millions, as a function of time in days.     (days)  (millions)                        Growth of Drosophila melanogaster  Looking at the table, we see that we multiply the fruit fly population by 2 every day, so that after days, the initial population is multiplied by . Because the population grows by a factor of 2 each day, the function describes exponential growth. We can express functions that describe exponential growth in a standard form.  Exponential Growth exponential growth exponential growth growth factor growth factor exponential growth initial value exponential growth initial value  The function describes exponential growth , where is the initial value of the function and the positive constant is the growth factor .  For the Drosophila cell population, the growth factor is , and the initial value is million cells, so we have There is a sort of similarity between the formula for exponential functions and the formula for linear functions. Each has an initial value and a constant that describes change. But compare the graph of exponential growth, described by a constant growth factor, with linear growth. You can see that the graph of the fruit fly population is not a straight line with a constant slope, as a linear function would be.  In 1985, there were about 1.2 million cell phone users world-wide. For some years after that time, the number grew by a factor of 1.5 each year.  Let be the number of cell phone users years after 1985 according to this model. Make a table of values and graph .  Write a formula for  How many cell phone users does this model predict for the year 2000?  Do you think this model will be valid indefinitely? Why or why not?    We let in 1985, so , in millions. Each value of can be obtained by multiplying the previous value by the growth factor, 1.5.                                  growth of cellphone owners  The initial value of the function is million. The annual growth factor is , so the formula is  The year 2000 is 15 years after 1985, so we evaluate the function for . The formula predicts that over 525 million people used cell phones in 2000.  It is unlikely that the model will be valid indefinitely, because will eventually exceed the population of Earth.   Once again, in the examples above, you can see that the graphs of these exponential functions are not linear. In each case, the function grows slowly at first, but eventually grows faster and faster.  Be careful when evaluating exponential growth functions. In part (c) of the previous Example, note that According to the order of operations, we compute the power first, and then multiply the result by 1.2.   To review the order of operations with powers, see Section 7.1.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 1  In the next Practice, we consider a population that doubles not every month, but every three months.  Practice 1  Graph for part (a):  rabbit population   In Practice 1, the rabbit population doubled every 3 months, leading to the growth law Notice how the 3 of \"every 3 months\" appears in the formula.  Now suppose we would like to know the monthly growth factor for the rabbit population, that is, by what factor did the population grow every month?  Recall that when we raise a power to a power we can multiply the exponents, like this: For example, Using the same idea for the rabbit population, we can see that So the growth factor for the rabbit population is , or about 1.26. The rabbit population grows by a factor of 1.26 every month.   Comparing Linear Growth and Exponential Growth exponential function vs linear growth exponential growth vs linear growth  It may be helpful to compare linear growth linear growth and exponential growth exponential growth. Consider the two functions whose graphs are shown below.                      Slope                     Growth factor  graph of linear and exponential  is a linear function with -intercept 5 and slope 2; is an exponential function with initial value 5 and growth factor 2. In a way, the growth factor of an exponential function is analogous to the slope of a linear function: Each measures how quickly the function is increasing.  However, for each unit increase in , 2 units are added to the value of , whereas the value of is multiplied by 2. An exponential function with growth factor 2 eventually grows much more rapidly than a linear function with slope 2, as you can see by comparing the graphs or the function values in the tables.   A solar energy company sold $80,000 worth of solar collectors last year, its first year of operation. This year its sales rose to $88,000. The marketing department must estimate its projected sales for the next 3 years.   If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow linearly, what sales total should it expect next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next 3 years, assuming that sales will grow linearly.  If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow exponentially, what sales total should it expect next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next 3 years, assuming that sales will grow exponentially.    Let represent the company's total sales years after starting business, where is the first year of operation. If sales grow linearly, then has the form . Because , the intercept is 80,000. The slope of the graph is where is the increase in sales during the first year. Thus, , and sales grow by adding $8000 each year. The expected sales total for the next year is  Let represent the company's sales assuming that sales will grow exponentially. Then has the form , and the initial value is . We find the growth factor in sales over the first year by dividing by : Thus, , and the expected sales total for the next year is   We evaluate each function at several points to obtain the graphs shown in the figure.                             linear and exponential growth    Exponential Decay  In the examples above, exponential growth was modeled by increasing functions increasing function of the form where the growth factor, , is a number greater than 1. If we multiply the function value by a number smaller than 1, t he function values will decrease. Thus, if , then is a decreasing function. decreasing function In this case, we say that the function describes exponential decay exponential decay , and the constant is called the decay factor decay factor exponential decay decay factor .  Observe that if , then powers of decrease as the exponent increases. For example, consider powers of .               Exponential Decay exponential decay  A small coal-mining town has been losing population since 1940, when 5000 people lived there. At each census thereafter (taken at 10-year intervals), the population declined to approximately 0.90 of its earlier figure.                                         Fill in the table showing the population of the town years after 1940.  Plot the data points and connect them with a smooth curve.  Write a function that gives the population of the town at any time in years after 1940.  Hint: Express the values you calculated in part (1) using powers of 0.90.

During the second half of the last century, the percent of beer volume sold in refillable glass bottles declined to 0.942 of its previous value each year.   In 1944, 98% of beer was sold in refillable bottles. Write a formula for the percent of beer sold in refillable bottles as a function of , the number of years after 1944.  Graph the function from 1944 to 2000.  In 1998, only 3.3% of beer was sold in refillable bottles. How well does the model predict this number?    We let in 1944, so that .

Practice 2  Graph for part (c):  exponential decay   QuickCheck 2   Percent Increase percent increase  Exponential growth is often described as growth by a certain percent increase. Suppose the town of Lakeview had 4000 residents in the year 2000, and grew at a rate of 5% per year. This means that each year we add 5% of last year's population to find the current population, . Thus and so on. Now here is the important observation about percent increase:    Thus, we can find the current population by multiplying the old population by 1.05. In other words,   A formula for the population of Lakeview years after 2000 is This formula describes exponential growth with a growth factor of . In general, a function that grows at a percent rate , where is expressed as a decimal, has a growth factor of .  Growth by a Constant Percent growth by a constant percent  The function describes exponential growth at a constant percent rate of growth, .  The initial value initial value of the function is , and is the growth factor exponential growth growth factor .  Many quantities besides population can grow by a fixed percent. For example, an inflation rate gives the percent rate at which prices are rising.  During a period of rapid inflation, prices rose by 12% each year. At the beginning of this time, a loaf of bread cost $2.  Make a table showing the cost of bread over the next four years.  Write a function that gives the price of a loaf of bread years after inflation began.  How much did a loaf of bread cost after 6 years? After 30 months?   Graph the function found in (b).    The percent increase in the cost of bread is 12% every year. Therefore, the growth factor for the cost of bread is every year. If represents the price of bread after years, then , and we multiply the price by 1.12 every year, as shown in the table.                                      After years of inflation the original price of $2 has been multiplied times by a factor of 1.12. Thus,  To find the price of bread at any time after inflation began, we evaluate the function at the appropriate value of . After 6 years the price was $3.95. Thirty months is 2.5 years, so we evaluate . After 30 months the price was $2.66.   To graph the function we evaluate it for several values, as shown in the table. We plot the points and connect them with a smooth curve to obtain the graph shown.  percent increase   For some hints on evaluating expponential expressions, see Section 7.1.3 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 3  Practice 3  grid for Tombstone, AZ population   Graph for part (c):  population Tombstone, AZ   Compound interest is another example of exponential growth. Suppose you deposit a sum of money, , into an account that pays 5% interest compounded annually. \"Compounded\" means that each year your interest, 5% of your current balance, is added to your account, so your balance, , grows by a factor of 1.05.  You can see this more clearly with a little calculation. At interest rate , after 1 year your balance is So the balance grew by a factor of . After the second year, the new balance of grows by another factor of , giving In general, we have the following formula.  Compound Interest compound interest balance compound interest compound interest balance compound interest principal  If a principal principal of dollars is invested in an account that pays an interest rate compounded annually, the balance balance  after years is given by  As an example, suppose you put $100 in an account that pays 5% interest compounded annually. Using the formula above, we can make a table showing the balance in your account over the next few years.                        Percent Decrease percent decrease  We have seen that a percent increase of (in decimal form) corresponds to a growth factor of . A percent decrease of corresponds to a decay factor decay factor of . For example, if a population declines by 25% each year, then each year the new population is 75% of its previous value. So and . Remember that multiplying by gives us the population remaining, not the amount of decline.  To review percent increase and decrease, see Section 7.1.1 of the Toolkit.  According to Context magazine: \"Computing prices have been falling exponentially for the past 30 years and will probably stay on that curve for another couple of decades.\" In fact, prices have been falling at a rate of 37% every year. Suppose an accounting firm invests $50,000 this year in new computer equipment.   Write a formula for the cost of similar equipment years from now.  What would the same equipment cost 5 years from now?  Graph the function for .   The current cost of the equipment is . Every year, the cost of similar equipment is multiplied by After years, the cost of that equipment is  After 5 years, we have The cost of the equipment after 5 years is $4962.18.   We evaluate the function for several values of , and plot the points to obtain the graph shown.                  computing prices    In the preceding Example, the cost of computer equipment decreases by 37% each year, so 63% of the value remains, and the decay factor for the value function is 0.63, not 0.37. The function gives the cost remaining, not the amount that has declined.  Practice 4  Graph for part (c):  exponential decay   Compare these two descriptions of exponential decay:  Each year, the population decreases by 25% of its previous value.  Each year, the population decreases to 25% of its previous value.  In the first description, and . If the population this year is 100, next year it will be 75. If 25% of the population is gone, 75% remains.  In the second description, only 25% of the population remains, so . If the population this year is 100, next year it will be 25.

  "body": "Exponential Functions  Introduction  In , we studied functions that describe exponential growth or decay. A population of rabbits grew according to the formula , and a butterfly count decreased by . These functions are examples of the family of exponential functions. Here are some more examples. We define an exponential function as follows.  Exponential Function exponential function function exponential  An exponential function has the form   The positive constant is called the base base of an exponential function exponential function base of of the exponential function. The constant gives the -intercept, , of the graph because For the examples above, we find that the -intercepts are  QuickCheck 1   We do not allow to be negative, because if , then is not a real number for some values of . For example, if and , then is an imaginary number.  We also exclude as a base because for all values of ; hence the function is actually the constant function .  The constant can be negative, but for our work we'll consider only positive values of .   During the summer a population of fleas doubles in number every 5 days.  If a population starts with 10 fleas, write a formula for the number of fleas present after days.  How many fleas will there be after 1 week (7 days)?    We let represent the number of fleas present after days. The original population of 10 fleas doubles not every day, but every 5 days. A table of values for would look like this.                            Notice that the original population is multiplied by another factor of 2 every 5 days. We must divide by 5 to see how many times the population doubles. The formula for is thus  We evaluate the function for . To follow the order of operations, we simplify the power before multiplying by 10.  After one week there will be 26 fleas.   For more practice evaluating exponential functions, see Section 7.2.1 of the Toolkit.  In the Example above, we can also write the formula as (See Note 7.1.5 for another example of this calculation.) From this form see that the growth factor for this function is , or about 1.149. The flea population grows at about 14.9% per day.  Practice 1  Graph for part (b):  GC graph    Graphs of Exponential Functions  The graphs of exponential functions have two characteristic shapes, depending on whether the base, , is greater than or less than . As typical examples, consider the graphs of and shown below. Some values for and are recorded in the tables.                              exponential growth                               exponential decay   Notice that is an increasing function and is a decreasing function decreasing function . Both are concave up. In general, exponential functions have the following properties.  Properties of Exponential Functions, , properties of exponential functions exponential function concave up  If , the function is increasing increasing function and concave up;  if , the function is decreasing decreasing function and concave up.  The -intercept y -intercept is . There is no -intercept.   In the table for , you can see that as the -values decrease toward negative infinity, the corresponding -values decrease toward zero. As a result, the graph of decreases toward the -axis, but never touches it, as we move to the left.  The negative -axis is a horizontal asymptote asymptote horizontal horizontal asymptote for exponential functions with , as shown in figure (a).  For exponential functions with , the positive -axis is an asymptote, as illustrated in figure (b).  QuickCheck 2  How does the value of affect the graph? For increasing functions, the larger the value of the base, , the faster the function grows. In the Example below, we compare two exponential functions with different bases.  Compare the graphs of and .  First, we evaluate each function for several convenient values, as shown in the table.  Then we plot the points for each function and connect them with smooth curves. Note that for both functions, so their graphs have the same -intercept, .  For positive -values, is always larger than , and is increasing more rapidly. In the figure, we can see that climbs more rapidly than . However, for negative -values, is smaller than .                             two exponential growth functions    Practice 2   two exponential decay functions   Perhaps you see a similarity in the formula for exponential functions, , and the formula for linear functions, . In an exponential function the base tells us how fast the function increases or decreases, much as the slope does for linear functions, and the constant tells us the intial value when , as does the constant in the linear formula .  QuickCheck 3   Comparing Exponential and Power Functions exponential function vs power functions power function vs exponential function  We have studied several families of functions, including linear, quadratic, and power functions. Exponential functions are useful because they model growth or decline by a constant factor.  Exponential functions exponential function are not the same as the power functions power function we studied earlier. Although both involve expressions with exponents, it is the location of the variable that makes the difference.   A power function, , has a variable base and a constant exponent.  An exponential function, , has a constant base and a variable exponent.   Power Functions vs Exponential Functions exponential function vs power functions power function vs exponential functions        Power Functions  Exponential Functions   General formula     Description  variable base and constant exponent  constant base and variable exponent   Example     These two families of functions have very different properties, as well.  Which of the functions shown below is exponential, and which is a cubic power function? Find an equation for each.                                                        cubic and exponential functions  We can tell that is the exponential function because its values increase by a factor of 3 for each unit increase in . The base of the function is . We also see from the table that , so . Thus, must be the power function, . To find , we notice that , so , and .  As you can see from the figure, the graphs of the two functions in the previous Example are also quite different. In particular, note that the power function passes through the origin, while the exponential function approaches the negative -axis as a horizontal asymptote.  From the table, we see that , so the two graphs intersect at . (They also intersect at approximately .) However, if you compare the values of and for larger values of , you will see that eventually the exponential function overtakes the power function.  The relationship in holds true for all increasing power and exponential functions: For large enough values of , the exponential function will always be greater than the power function, regardless of the parameters in the functions. exponential growth vs power function increasing function The figure at left shows the graphs of and . At first, , but at around , overtakes , and for all .  power function vs exponential from 0 to 50  Practice 3  QuickCheck 4   Exponential Equations  An exponential equation exponential equation is one in which the variable is part of an exponent. For example, the equation is exponential.  Many exponential equations can be solved by writing both sides of the equation as powers with the same base. To solve the equation above, we write which is true if and only if . exponential equation solving  In general, if two equivalent powers have the same base, then their exponents must be equal also, as long as the base is not or .  In the next Example, we use the laws of exponents to express both sides of the equation as single powers of a common base.  Solve the following equations.       Using the fact that , we write each side of the equation as a power of : Now we equate the exponents to obtain The solution is .  We write each factor as a power of . We use the laws of exponents to simplify each side: Now we equate the exponents to obtain The solution is .   For more examples of exponential equations, see Section 7.2.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 5  Practice 4  Exponential equations arise frequently in the study of exponential growth.  In Example 1 we wrote a formula for a population of fleas that started with 10 fleas and doubles in number every 5 days. How long will it be before there are 10,240 fleas?  We set and solve for : We equate the exponents to get , or . The population will grow to 10,240 fleas in 50 days.   QuickCheck 6   Graphical Solution of Exponential Equations exponential equation graphical solution of  It is not always so easy to express both sides of the equation as powers of the same base. In the following sections, we will develop more general methods for finding exact solutions to exponential equations. But we can use a graphing utility to obtain approximate solutions. exponential equation solving  intersect Use the graph of to find an approximate solution to the equation accurate to the nearest hundredth.  We enter  X to obtain the graph shown in figure (a). We are looking for a point on this graph with -coordinate .  Using the TRACE feature, we see that the -coordinates are too small when and too large when . The solution we want lies somewhere between and , but this approximation is not accurate enough.  Geogebra graph of 2 to x  Geogebra graph of 2 to x and of y=5  To improve our approximation, we can use the intersect feature because the -coordinate of the intersection point of the two graphs is the solution of the equation . Activating the intersect command results in figure (b), and we see that, to the nearest hundredth, the solution is .  We can verify that our estimate is reasonable by substituting into the equation: Evaluating yields . This number is not equal to , but it is close, so we believe that is a reasonable approximation to the solution of the equation .  To review solving with a graph, see Section 7.2.3 of the Toolkit.

Much the same way as a square root \"undoes\" the squaring function, a logarithm undoes an exponential function.  A Logarithm is an Exponent  Suppose that a colony of bacteria doubles in size every day. If the colony starts with 50 bacteria, how long will it be before there are 800 bacteria?  We answer questions of this type by writing and solving an exponential equation. The initial value of the population is , and the growth factor is . Thus, the function gives the number of bacteria present on day , and we must solve the equation We are looking for an unknown exponent on base 2. Dividing both sides by 50 yields This equation asks the question: \"To what power must we raise 2 in order to get 16?\"  Because , we see that the solution of the equation is . You can check that solves the original problem: The unknown exponent that solves the equation is called the base logarithm logarithm of . The exponent in this case is , and we write this fact as In other words, we solved an exponential equation by computing a logarithm. We make the following definition.  Definition of Logarithm logarithm base of a logarithm exponent logarithm base  For and ,  the base logarithm of base is the exponent to which must be raised in order to yield .  We write the logarithm as .   Some logarithms, like some square roots, are easy to evaluate, while others require a calculator. We'll start with the easy ones.  Here are some examples of logarithms.  because  because  because  because    We see that in each example the logarithm is the exponent we need on the given base.  To review writing radicals with exponents, see Section 7.3.1 of the Toolkit.  So the request to compute a logarithm really says \"Find me the exponent!\"  Practice 1  From the definition of a logarithm and the examples above, we see that the following two statements are equivalent.  Logarithms and Exponents: Conversion Equations conversion equations logarithm conversion equations  If , , and ,   This equivalence tells us that the logarithm, , is the same as the exponent in . We see again that a logarithm is an exponent ; it is the exponent to which must be raised to yield .  For example, to convert the equation to exponential form, we note that the base is and the logarithm is , so the exponent on base 5 will be 3, like this: .  The conversion equations allow us to convert from logarithmic to exponential form, or vice versa. It will help you to become familiar with the conversion, because we will use it frequently.  As special cases of the equivalence above, we can compute the following useful logarithms.  Some Useful Logarithms logarithm some useful  For any base ,   Here are some more examples. Once again, we are looking for the exponent on the given base to get .   because  because  because, well,   QuickCheck 1   Logs and Exponential Equations  We use logarithms to solve exponential equations, just as we use square roots to solve quadratic equations. Consider the two equations We solve the first equation by taking a square root, and we solve the second equation by computing a logarithm: The operation of taking a base logarithm is the inverse operation for raising the base to a power, just as extracting square roots is the inverse of squaring a number.  Every exponential equation can be rewritten in logarithmic form by using the conversion equations. Thus, are equivalent statements, just as are equivalent statements. Rewriting an equation in logarithmic form is a basic strategy for finding its solution.  Rewrite each equation in logarithmic form.       First identify the base , and then the exponent or logarithm . Use the conversion equations to rewrite in the form .  The base is and the exponent is Thus, .  The base is and the exponent is Thus, .  The base is and the exponent is Thus, .  The base is and the exponent is Thus, .   Practice 2  We can solve an exponential equation by converting the equation to logarithmic form.  Solve each equation by converting to logarithmic form.        In this case we can see by inspection that the solution is , or  The log form is , which is not easy to evaluate without a calculator.   For more help examples of using logs, see Section 7.3.3 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2   Approximating Logarithms  Now let's consider computing logarithms that are not obvious by inspection. Suppose we would like to solve the equation The solution of this equation is , but can we find a decimal approximation for this value? There is no integer power of 2 that equals 26, because So must be between 4 and 5. We can use trial and error to find the value of to the nearest tenth. Use your calculator to make a table of values for , starting with and using increments of 0.1.                                         From the table we see that is between and , and is closer to . To the nearest tenth, .  Trial and error can be a time-consuming process. In the next Example we illustrate a graphical method for estimating the value of a logarithm.   Approximate to the nearest hundredth.  If , then . We will use the graph of to approximate a solution to .  We graph X and in the same window to obtain the graph shown below. Next we activate the intersect feature to find that the two graphs intersect at the point . Because this point lies on the graph of , we know that To the nearest hundredth, .  GC intersection of expnential curve and horizontal line   Practice 4   Base 10 Logarithms  Some logarithms are used so frequently in applications that their values are programmed into scientific and graphing calculators. These are the base 10 logarithms, such as Base 10 logarithms are called common logarithms common logarithms base 10 logarithms common logarithms logarithms common (base 10) , and the subscript 10 is often omitted, so that is understood to mean .  QuickCheck 3  To evaluate a base 10 logarithm, we use the LOG key on a calculator. Many logarithms are irrational numbers, and the calculator gives as many digits as its display allows. We can then round off to the desired accuracy.  Approximate the following logarithms to 2 decimal places.      The keying sequence LOG   ) ENTER yields , so .  The keying sequence LOG   )  ENTER yields , so .   We can check the approximations found in with our conversion equations. Remember that a logarithm is an exponent, and in this example the base is 10. We find that so our approximations are reasonable, although you can see that rounding a logarithm to 2 decimal places does lose some accuracy.  For this reason, rounding logarithms to 4 decimal places is customary.  Practice 5  QuickCheck 4   Solving Exponential Equations  We can now solve any exponential equation with base 10.  Solve the equation   First, we isolate the power of 10: We subtract 95 from both sides of the equation and divide by to obtain Next, we convert the equation to logarithmic form as Solving for yields We can evaluate this expression on the calculator by entering  LOG   )    ENTER  which yields . Thus, to four decimal places, .  Do not omit the parenthesis when entering the expression in . Without the parenthesis, you are calculating . You can check that this is not the same as .  To solve exponential equations involving powers of 10, we can use the following steps.  Steps for Solving Exponential Equations exponential equation solving exponential equation solving with logarithms   Isolate the power on one side of the equation.  Rewrite the equation in logarithmic form.  Use a calculator, if necessary, to evaluate the logarithm.  Solve for the variable.   QuickCheck 5  Practice 6   Application to Exponential Models  We have seen that exponential functions are used to describe some applications of growth and decay, . There are two common questions that arise in connection with exponential models:  Given a value of , what is the corresponding value of ?  Given a value of , what is the corresponding value of ?  To answer the first question, we evaluate the function at the appropriate value. To answer the second question, we must solve an exponential equation, and this usually involves logarithms.  The value of a large tractor originally worth $30,000 depreciates exponentially according to the formula where is in years. When will the tractor be worth half its original value?  We want to find the value of for which . That is, we want to solve the equation Once we have isolated the power, we convert the equation to logarithmic form. To evaluate this expression, we key in  LOG   )   (-)   ENTER  to find . The tractor will be worth $15,000 in approximately years.   QuickCheck 6  Practice 7  At this stage, it seems we will only be able to solve exponential equations in which the base is 10. However, we will see in future sections how the properties of logarithms enable us to solve exponential equations with any base.    Problem Set 7.3  Warm Up  There were 300 lizards on a small island in 2000, and since then the population has been growing by 15% each year.  Write a formula for the size of the lizard population years after 2000.  Write an equation to calculate how long it will take the lizard population to reach 500.  Use trial and error to estimate the solution to the equation.      Complete each table. Then use the tables to approximate each logarithm between two integers.                                                                            Skills Practice  For Problems 3-8, use the definition to find each logarithm without using a calculator.                              For Problems 9 and 10, without using a calculator, estimate the logarithm between two integers.           For Problems 11 16, solve. Round your answers to hundredths.         For Problems 17 and 18, rewrite each equation in logarithmic form.            For Problems 19 and 20, rewrite each equation in exponential form.      b^{-2} = 9      Solve each equation, writing your answer as a logarithm. Then use trial and error to approximate the logarithm to tenths.      For Problems 22 24, use a graph to approximate each logarithm to the nearest hundredth. (Hint: Graph an appropriate function .)       Applications  In 2015, Summit City used 4.2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and the demand for electricity has increased every year according to the formula   When will Summit City need 10 million kilowatt-hours annually?  What is the annual growth rate in the demand for electricity?  2030  6.2%  Radium, a radioactive element, was used to paint watches and instrument dials until its serious health effects were discovered in the 1920's. Although some isotopes of radium take hundres of years to decay, Radium-228 decays according to the formula where is in years.  How long will it take for one gram of radium-228 to decay to one-half gram?  What is the annual decay rate for radium-228?  The atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude above the surface of the Earth, according to the function where is altitude given in miles, and is atmospheric pressure in inches of mercury. Graph this function in the window Solve Problems 27 and 28 algebraically, then verify with your graph.   The elevation of Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, is 29,028 feet. What is the atmospheric pressure at the top?  Hint: 1 mile = 5280 feet  The atmospheric pressure at the top of Mount McKinley, the highest peak in the United States, is 13.51 inches of mercury. Estimate the elevation of Mount McKinley.  9.60 in  3.85 mi   What is the atmospheric pressure at sea level ( )?  Find the height above sea level at which the atmospheric pressure is equal to one-half the pressure at sea level.   From 1950 to 2000, the population of the state of Nevada increased according to the formula where is measured in years since 1950.  What was the population in 2000?  What was the annual percent growth rate from 1950 to 2000?  According to this model, when would the population of Nevada reach 3,000,000? (In fact the population of Nevada was 3,139,658 in 2020.)   2,018,436  5.17%  2008   From 1970 to 1990, the population of the state of California increased according to the formula where is measured in years since 1970.  What was the population in 1990?  What was the annual percent growth rate from 1970 to 1990?  According to this model, when would the population of California reach 40,000,000? (In fact the population of California was 39,747,267 in 2020.)   Equations Practice: For Problems 31 and 32, solve the equation and check your solutions.

  "body": "Properties of Logarithms  So far we've seen that taking a logarithm is the opposite or inverse of raising to a power, so that we can use logarithms to solve exponential equations. And with the help of a calculator we can use base 10 or \"common\" logarithms to find approximate solutions to equations in base 10. Now we'll see how to use properties of logarithms to solve exponential equations with any base.  Logarithms and Exponents  Because logarithms are actually exponents, they have several properties that can be derived from the laws of exponents. Here are the laws we will need at present.   To review some applications of the laws of exponents, see Section 7.4.1 of the Toolkit.   To multiply two powers with the same base, add the exponents and leave the base unchanged.  To divide two powers with the same base, subtract the exponents and leave the base unchanged.  To raise a power to a power, keep the same base and multiply the exponents.   Each of these laws corresponds to a property of logarithms.  Properties of Logarithms logarithm properties  If and and , then      To help you see why these properties work, study the examples below, keeping in mind that a logarithm is an exponent.   Property (1):  Property (2):  Property (3):   QuickCheck 1   Using the Properties of Logarithms  Of course, these properties are useful not so much for computing logs but rather for simplifying expressions that contain variables. We will use them to solve exponential equations. But first, we will practice applying the properties.  At this point, it may also be helpful to compare the distributive law with the log properties. See Section 7.4.2 of the Toolkit.  Write as an expression in simpler logs.  First, we write using a fractional exponent: Thus, .  Practice 1  We can also use the properties of logarithms to combine sums and differences of logarithms into one logarithm.  Express as a single logarithm with a coefficient of .  We begin by applying Property (2) to combine the logs. Thus, .  Be careful when using the properties of logarithms! Compare the statements below:   but    but    Practice 2  QuickCheck 2   Solving Exponential Equations exponential equation solving with logarithms  By using Property (3), we can now solve exponential equations in which the base is not 10. For example, to solve the equation we could rewrite the equation in logarithmic form to obtain the exact solution However, we cannot evaluate ; there is no \"log base 5 button\" on the calculator. If we want a decimal approximation for the solution, we begin by taking the base 10 logarithm of both sides, even though the base of the power is not 10. This gives us Then we use Property (3) to rewrite the left side as and divide both sides by to get On your calculator, enter the sequence  LOG   )   LOG   )  ENTER  to find that .  Note how using Property (3) allows us to solve the equation above: The variable, , is no longer in the exponent, and it is multiplied by a constant, .  Do not confuse the expression with ; they are not the same! Although We cannot simplify ; we must evaluate it as  Solve   First we divide both sides by 80 to isolate the power. Next, we take the base 10 logarithm of both sides of the equation and use Property (3) to get On the right side of the equation, is multiplied by two constants, and . So, to solve for we must divide both sides of the equation by . We use a calculator to evaluate the answer: (On your calculator, remember to enclose the entire denominator, , in parentheses.)  To compare solving exponential equations and power equations, see Section 7.4.3 of the Toolkit.  In the previous example, do not try to simplify Remember that the order of operations tells us to compute the power before multiplying by 80. To solve the equation, we must first isolate the power with the variable exponent.  Practice 3  By using the properties of logarithms, we can now solve equations that arise in exponential growth and decay models, no matter what base the exponential function uses.  The population of Silicon City was 6500 in 1990 and has been tripling every 12 years. When will the population reach 75,000?  The population of Silicon City grows according to the formula where is the number of years after. We want to find the value of for which ; that is, we want to solve the equation To isolate the power, we divide both sides by 6500 to get Now we can take the base 10 logarithm of both sides and solve for . We use a calculator to evaluate the answer, . The population of Silicon City will reach 75,000 about 27 years after 1990, or in 2017.  Practice 4  QuickCheck 3   Solving Formulas  We can also solve formulas involving exponential or logarithmic expressions for one variable in terms of the others.  Solve for . ( and .)  First, we divide both sides by to isolate the power. Then we write the exponential equation in logarithmic form:  Practice 5  One final note about finding approximate values for logarithms. As we saw earlier, the solution of the equation is , but by taking the log base 10 of both sides of the equation we obtained the solution in the form Because these two expressions for the solution must be equal, we have This equation is an example of the change of base formula.  Change of Base Formula  For positive values of , and , and ,  We can use the change of base formula to convert any logarithm to base 10, or any other convenient base.

  "body": "Exponential Models  Using what we have learned about exponential functions and logarithms, we can now explore some exponential models. In this secction we'll see how to fit an exponential function to data and how to use doubling time and half-life.  Fitting an Exponential Function through Two Points  To write a formula for an exponential function , we need to know the initial value, initial value , and the growth or decay factor, . We can find these two parameters if we know any two function values.  Find an exponential function that has the values and .  We would like to find values of and so that the given function values satisfy . By substituting the function values into the formula, we can write two equations. We now have a system of equations in the two unknowns and : but it is not a linear system. We can solve the system by the method of elimination, but instead of adding the equations, we will divide one of the equations by the other. Note that by dividing the two equations, we eliminated , and we can now solve for . Next we substitute into either of the two equations and solve for . Thus, and , and the function is .  Knowing only two points on the graph of is not enough to tell us what kind of function is. Through the two points in , we can also fit a linear function or a power function.  You can check that the three functions below all satisfy and . The graphs of the functions are shown at right.  three functions through the same two points   However, if we already know that we are looking for an exponential function, we can follow the steps below to find its formula. This method is sometimes called the ratio method ratio method . (Of course, if one of the known function values is the initial value, we can find without resorting to the ratio method.)   To find an exponential function through two points: exponential function finding a formula     Use the coordinates of the points to write two equations in and .   Divide one equation by the other to eliminate .  Solve for .  Substitute into either equation and solve for .     Practice 1  QuickCheck 1  We can use the ratio method to find an exponential growth or decay model if we know two function values.  The unit of currency in Ghana is the cedi, denoted by ¢. Beginning in 1986, the cedi underwent a period of exponential inflation. In 1993, one U.S. dollar was worth ¢720, and in 1996, the dollar was worth about ¢1620. Find a formula for the number of cedi to the dollar as a function of time since 1986. What was the annual inflation rate during the decade from 1986 to 1996?  We want to find a function for the number of cedi to the dollar, where in 1986. We have two function values, , and , and with these values we can write two equations. We divide the second equation by the first to find Now we can solve this last equation for to get . Finally, we substitute into the first equation to find . Thus, . Finally, recall that to see that the annual inflation rate was 31%.  For help interpreting function notation, see Section 7.5.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 2   Doubling Time doubling time  Instead of giving the rate of growth of a population, we often specify its rate of growth by giving the time it takes for the population to double. Let us see how those two descriptions are connected.  In 2005, the population of Egypt was 74 million and was growing by 2% per year.  If it continues to grow at the same rate, how long will it take the population of Egypt to double?  How long will it take the population to double again?  Illustrate the results on a graph.    The population of Egypt is growing according to the formula where is in years and is in millions. We would like to know when the population will reach 148 million (twice 74 million), so we solve the equation It will take the population about 35 years to double.  Twice 148 million is 296 million, so we solve the equation It will take the population about 35 years to double again.  A graph of is shown below. Note that the population doubles every 35 years.  graph showing doubling time   In the Example above, notice that the calculations in parts (a) and (b) are identical after the first step, and give the same result, 35 years. In fact, we can start at any time, and it will take the population 35 years to double. We say that 35 years is the doubling time for this population. Every increasing exponential function exponential growth has a constant doubling time. And if a function has a constant doubling time, it must be exponential.  Practice 3  QuickCheck 2  If we know the doubling time for a population, we can immediately write down its growth law. Because the population of Egypt doubles in 35 years, we can write In this form, the growth factor for the population is , and you can check that, to five decimal places, .  Doubling Time doubling time  If is the doubling time for an exponential function , then   So, from knowing the doubling time, we can easily find the growth rate of a population.  At its current rate of growth, the population of the United States will double in 115.87 years.   Write a formula for the population of the United States as a function of time.  What is the annual percent growth rate of the population?    The current population of the United States is not given, so we represent it by . With expressed in years, the formula is then  We write in the form to see that the growth factor is , or 1.006. For exponential growth, , so , or 0.6%.   Practice 4   Half-Life half-life  The half-life half-life of a decreasing exponential function is the time it takes for the output to decrease to half its original value. For example, the half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The half-life of a drug is the time it takes for half of the drug to be eliminated from the body. Like the doubling time, the half-life is constant for a particular function; no matter where you start, it takes the same amount of time to reach half that value.  If you take mg of ibuprofen to relieve sore muscles, the amount of the drug left in your body after hours is .  What is the half-life of ibuprofen?  When will 50 mg of ibuprofen remain in your body?  Use the half-life to sketch a graph of .    To find the half-life, we calculate the time elapsed when only half the original amount, or 100 mg, is left. The half-life is 2.2 hours.  After 2.2 hours, 100 mg of ibuprofen is left in the body. After another 2.2 hours, half of that amount, or 50 mg, is left. Thus, 50 mg remain after 4.4 hours.  We locate multiples of 2.2 hours on the horizontal axis. After each interval of 2.2 hours, the amount of ibuprofen is reduced to half its previous value. The graph is shown below.   graph showing half-life                   Practice 5  QuickCheck 3  Just as we can write an exponential growth law in terms of its doubling time, we can use the half-life to write a formula for exponential decay. exponential decay For example, the half-life of ibuprofen is 2.2 hours, so every 2.2 hours the amount remaining is reduced by a factor of 0.5. After hours a 200-mg dose will be reduced to Once again, you can check that this formula is equivalent to the decay function given in the previous Example.  Half-Life half-life  If is the half-life for an exponential function , then   Radioactive isotopes are molecules that decay into more stable molecules, emitting radiation in the process. Although radiation in large doses is harmful to living things, radioactive isotopes are useful as tracers in medicine and industry, and as treatment against cancer. The decay laws for radioactive isotopes are often given in terms of their half-lives.  Cobalt-60 is used in cold pasteurization to sterilize certain types of food. Gamma rays emitted by the isotope during radioactive decay kill any bacteria present without damaging the food. The half-life of cobalt-60 is 5.27 years.   Write a decay law for cobalt-60.  What is the annual decay rate for cobalt-60?    We let denote the amount of cobalt-60 left after years, and let denote the initial amount. Every 5.27 years, is reduced by a factor of 0.5, so  We rewrite the decay law in the form as follows: Thus, , so , or 12.32%.   For more examples of doubling time and half-life, see Section 7.5.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6  QuickCheck 4   Compound Interest  In Section 7.1.5 we considered a formula for interest compounded annually. Many accounts compound interest more frequently than once a year. If the interest is compounded times per year, then in years there will be compounding periods, and in each period the account earns interest at a rate of . The amount accumulated is given by a generalization of our earlier formula.  Compound Interest  The amount accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account earning interest compounded times annually is where is the principal invested, is the interest rate, and is the time period, in years.  Nigel deposited $1000 in an account that pays 4% interest. Calculate the amount in his account after 5 years if the interest is compounded  quarterly  monthly    Quarterly means 4 times a year, so we use the compound interest formula with . If interest is compounded quarterly, the balance in the account after 5 years is $1220.19.  There are 12 months in a year, so we use the compound interest formula with . If interest is compounded quarterly, the balance in the account after 5 years is $1221.   In Example 7.1.18 above, you can see that the larger the value of , the greater the value of . More frequent compounding periods result in a higher account balance.    Problem Set 7.5  Warm Up  For Problems 1-4, solve.

Then find the percent growth or decay rate.  A population starts with 2000 and has a doubling time of 5 years. 14.9%  You have 10 grams of a radioactive isotope whose half-life is 42 years.  A certain medication has a half-life of 18 hours in the body. You are given an initial dose of mg. 3.8%  The doubling time of a certain financial investment is 8 years. You invest an amount .   In 1798, the English political economist Thomas R.

Write a growth law for human populations under these conditions.  What is the growth rate in unconstrained conditions?    2.81%   David Sifry observed in 2005 that over the previous two years, the number of Weblogs, or blogs, was doubling every 5 months.

Your first cup of coffee in the morning has 100 mg of caffeine.  How long will it take before you have 50 mg of that caffeine in your body?  How long will it take before you have 25 mg of that caffeine in your body?  Using your answers to (a) and (b), make a rough sketch of the decay function.   Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) is a pesticide that was used in the middle decades of the twentieth century to control malaria. After 1945, it was also widely used on crops in the United States, and as much as one ton might be sprayed on a single cotton field. However, after the toxic effects of DDT on the environment began to appear, the chemical was banned in 1972.  A common estimate for the half-life of DDT in the soil is 15 years. Write a decay law for DDT in the soil.  In 1970, many soil samples in the United States contained about 0.5 mg of DDT per kg of soil. The NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) safe level for DDT in the soil is 0.008 mg\/kg. When will DDT content in the soil be reduced to a safe level?    After 89.5 years, or in 2060  In 1986, the inflation rate in Bolivia was 8000% annually. The unit of currency in Bolivia is the boliviano.  Write a formula for the price of an item as a function of time. Let be its initial price.  How long did it take for prices to double? Give both an exact value and a decimal approximation rounded to two decimal places.  Suppose bolivianos. Graph your function in the window , , , .  Use intersect to verify that the price of the item doubles from 5 to 10 bolivianos, from 10 to 20, and from 20 to 40 in equal periods of time.   In Problems 25 and 26,  Write a decay law for the isotope.  Use the decay law to answer the question. (Round to the nearest ten years.)   In living organisms, carbon-14 occurs with a fixed ratio to nonradioactive carbon-12. After a plant or animal dies, the carbon-14 decays into stable carbon with a halflife of 5730 years. When samples from the Shroud of Turin were analyzed in 1988, they were found to have 91.2% of their original carbon-14. How old were those samples in 1988?   About 760 years old   Rubidium-strontium radioactive dating is used in geologic studies to measure the age of minerals. Rubidium-87 decays into strontium-87 with a half-life of 48.8 billion years.

Logarithms and Exponents: Conversion Equations  If , , and ,  Some Useful Logarithms  For any base ,   We use logarithms to solve exponential equations, just as we use square roots to solve quadratic equations. The operation of taking a base logarithm is the inverse of raising the base to a power, just as extracting square roots is the inverse of squaring a number.  Steps for Solving Base 10 Exponential Equations   Isolate the power on one side of the equation.  Rewrite the equation in logarithmic form.  Use a calculator, if necessary, to evaluate the logarithm.  Solve for the variable.   Properties of Logarithms  If and and , then      Steps for Solving Exponential Equations   Isolate the power on one side of the equation.  Take the base 10 logarithm of both sides of the equation.  Apply the third property of logarithms to simplify.  Use a calculator, if necessary, to evaluate the logarithm.  Solve for the variable.

  "body": "Polynomial Functions  Introduction  As noted in the introduction to this chapter, the graphs of polynomial functions have a variety of different shapes, so they are useful for modeling curves. In addition, polynomials are easy to evaluate, so they can be used to compute approximate values for other functions, such as exponentials and logarithms. In this section we'll learn some of the algebraic techniques for studying and using polynomials.   What are Polynomials?  We have already encountered some examples of polynomial functions. Linear functions, and quadratic functions are special cases of polynomial functions. Polynomials can also include terms with higher powers of the variable. Here are some examples. In general, we make the following definition.  Polynomial Function  A polynomial function polynomial function function polynomial has the form where , , , , are constants and .  The coefficient of the highest power term is called the lead coefficient, lead coefficient polynomial lead coefficient and the highest power is the degree degree of the polyomial.  Each of the polynomials above is written in descending powers descending powers polynomial descending powers , which means that the highest-degree degree (of a polynomial) term comes first, and the degrees of the terms decrease from largest to smallest. Sometimes it is useful to write a polynomial in ascending powers ascending powers polynomial ascending powers , so that the degrees of the terms increase. For example, the polynomial above would be written as in ascending powers.  QuickCheck 1  We can evaluate polynomials just as we do for any other function.  Evaluate the polynomial at and at .   We substitute the values given for and follow the order of operations.    Here is a graph of the polynomial.  x-cubed-.5xsquared-4x+2    Products of Polynomials polynomial products of  In of Section 3.2 we solved a quadratic equation by factoring. As another example, because the solutions of the equation are and . But now notice that the product of the two linear polynomials and is a quadratic polynomial. Or, in other words, the product of two first-degree polynomials gives us a second-degree polynomial. In fact, whenever we multiply two or more polynomials together, we get another polynomial of higher degree.  Compute the products.      diagram of polynomial multiplication  For help multiplying polynomials, see Section 8.1.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1  In part (a) of the Example above, we multiplied a polynomial of degree one by a polynomial of degree three, and the product was a polynomial of degree four. In part (b) of the Example, the product of three first-degree polynomials is a third-degree polynomial.  Degree of a Product degree (of a polynomial) of a product  The degree of a product of non-zero polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the factors. That is:  If has degree and has degree , then their product has degree .  Let , and .  What is the degree of their product? What is the coefficient of the lead term?  Find the coefficient of the -term of the product.    The degree of is 4, and the degree of is 3, so the degree of their product is . The only degree 7 term of the product is , which has coefficient 15.  In the product, each term of is multiplied by each term of . How might we isolate the products that result in terms sof degree 3? We get degree 3 terms by multiplying together terms of degree 0 and 3, or of degree 1 and 2. For these polynomials, the possible combinations are:      Product                   The sum of the third-degree terms of the product is , with coefficient 34.   Practice 2  QuickCheck 2   Modeling with Polynomials polynomial modeling with  Polynomials are used to model many variable relationships, including volume and surface area. surface area  A closed box has a square base of length and width inches and a height of inches, as shown at right.  box with height x-6 inches with both length and width of x inches   Write a polynomial function that gives the surface area of the box in terms of the dimensions of the base.  What is the surface area of a box of length and width 18 inches?  Write a polynomial function for the volume of the box.    The surface area of a box is the sum of the areas of its six faces, Substituting for and , and for gives us  We evaluate the polynomial for to find  You probably recall that the formula for the volume of a box is , the product of its length, width, and height. So the box has volume .   Practice 3  rectangular hole 3 ft deep, x feet wide, x+8 ft long    Cubic Polynomials  The volume of the box in Example 9, , is an example of a cubic polynomial  polynomial cubic , a polynomial of degree 3. Cubic polynomials are often used in economics to model cost functions. The cost of producing items is an increasing function of , but its rate of increase is usually not constant.  Pegasus Printing, Ltd. is launching a new magazine. The cost of printing thousand copies is given by  What are the fixed costs , that is, the costs incurred before any copies are printed?  Graph the cost function in the window below and describe the graph.  How many copies can be printed for $1200?  What does the concavity of the graph tell you about the cost function? (See to review concavity.)    Fixed costs are given by , or $250. The fixed costs include expenses like utility bills that must be paid even if no magazines are produced.  The graph is shown in figure (a). It is increasing from a vertical intercept of 250. The graph is concave down for approximately, and concave up for .  GC graphs of a cubic cost function  We must solve the equation We will solve the equation graphically, as shown in figure (b). Graph along with the cost function, and use the intersect command to find the intersection point of the graphs, . when is about 15,319, so 15,319 copies can be printed for $1200.  Although the cost is always increasing, it increases very slowly from about to about . The flattening of the graph in this interval is a result of economy of scale : By buying supplies in bulk and using time efficiently, the cost per magazine can be minimized. However, if the production level is too large, costs begin to rise rapidly again.   In c, we solved a cubic equation graphically. There is a cubic formula, cubic formula analogous to the quadratic formula, that allows us to solve cubic equations polynomial cubic algebraically, but it is complicated and not often used in applications.  Cubic polynomials polynomial cubic are also used to model smooth curves connecting given points. Such a curve is called a cubic spline cubic spline .  Practice 4  Graph for part (b)  cubic   QuickCheck 3   Approximations with Polynomials  Did you ever wonder how your calculator obtains decimal values for numbers such as or ? One way to do it is to use a polynomial. Functions such as and can be approximated by polynomials, and the higher the degree of the polynomial, the better the approximation. Because evaluating a polynomial uses only addition and multiplication, calculators and computers can perform the calculations quickly and give us decimal values with great accuracy.   Evaluate the polynomial at to find an approximation for .  Use a calculator to evaluate . How close is your approximation from part (a)?    Substituting into we find  A calculator returns the value . Our approximation is accurate to four decimal places. One can use a polynomial of higher degree to obtain an approximation with greater accuracy.    Special Products  As we saw in Chapter 3 , many quadratic polynomials can be factored into a product of two linear expressions, and these factors give us information about the roots of a quadratic equation or the -intercepts of its graph. The same is true of cubic polynomials, so we will take a brief look at how they can be factored.  To begin, recall the following special products involving quadratic expressions.  Special Products of Binomials special products of binomials binomial special products of polynomial quadratic    To review products of binomials, see Section 8.1.2 of the Toolkit.  There are also special products resulting in cubic polynomials. In the Homework problems, you will be asked to verify the following products.  Cube of a Binomial binomial cube of cube of a binomial polynomial cubic      If you become familiar with these general forms, you can use them as patterns to find specific examples of such products.  Write as a polynomial.  Use product above, with replaced by and replaced by .   For help using formulas, see Section 8.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Of course, we can also expand the product simply by polynomial multiplication and arrive at the same answer.  Practice 6  QuickCheck 4   Factoring Cubics polynomial cubic  Another pair of products is useful for factoring cubic polynomials. Here are two more products you will be asked to verify in the Homework problems.

Factoring the Sum or Difference of Two Cubes factoring cubics polynomial cubic      Note the difference between the expressions and ; they are not the same! You can see this easily if you refer back to the box for the cube of a binomial. You already know that is not equivalent to because , and in fact for any power (except 1) the expressions and are not equivalent.  When we recognize a polynomial as a sum or difference of two perfect cubes, we can then identify the two cubed expressions and apply the formula.  Factor each polynomial.      This polynomial is a sum of two cubes. The cubed expressions are , because , and . Use formula as a pattern, replacing with , and with .  This polynomial is a difference of two cubes.

  "body": "Algebraic Fractions  Introduction  In applications, variables may occur in the numerator or denominator of a fraction, or both. For example, the time it takes for the Moon to eclipse the Sun is given by the formula where the variables give the diameter of the Sun and the distances of the Moon and Sun from Earth. The total resistance of two appliances with resistances and connected in parallel is given by  These two formulas involve simple poynomials in more than one variable. Let's start our study of fractions with expressions that include only one variable.  Algebraic Fraction  An algebraic fraction algebraic fraction (or rational expression rational expression rational expression algebraic fraction , as they are sometimes called) is a fraction in which both numerator and denominator are polynomials.  Here are some examples of algebraic fractions: We can evaluate algebraic fractions just as we evaluate any other algebraic expression.  If we try to evaluate the fraction for , we get or , which is undefined. When working with fractions, we must exclude any values of the variable that make the denominators equal to zero.   Reducing Fractions reducing fractions  You'll recall from your study of arithmetic that we can reduce fraction reducing reducing fractions a fraction if we can divide both numerator and denominator by a common factor common factor fraction common factor common factor fraction . In algebra, it is helpful to think of factoring out the common factor first. For example, where we have divided both numerator and denominator by 9. The new fraction has the same value as the old one, namely 0.75, but it is simpler (the numbers are smaller.) Reducing is an application of the Fundamental Principle of Fractions.  Fundamental Principle of Fractions fraction fundamental principal fundamental principal of fractions reducing fractions  We can multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero factor, and the new fraction will be equivalent to the old one.  Reduce  The common factor for numerator and denominator is . We factor from the numerator and denominator, then divide by the common factor.   Practice 1  When we cancel common factors, we are dividing . Because division is the inverse or opposite operation for multiplication, we can cancel common factors , but we cannot cancel common terms .  Use your calculator to decide which calculation is correct.    We can cancel the 4's in part (a), because they are factors of numerator and denominator.  We cannot cancel the 4's in part (b), because they are terms.  You can verify that , but .   QuickCheck 1  Practice 2  If the numerator or denominator of the fraction contains more than one term, it is especially important to factor before reducing , so that numerator and denominator are written as products of factors, instead of as sums of terms.  Reduce each fraction.     First we factor the numerator and denominator. Then we divide numerator and denominator by any common factors.      To refresh your factoring skills, see Section 8.2.1 of the Toolkit.  We cannot cancel the 4's in part (a) of the Example above, because 4 is not a factor of the entire numerator. Thus, In part (b) of the Example, we cannot cancel the 3's, because they are terms and not factors. Thus,   Practice 3  We summarize the procedure for reducing algebraic fractions as follows.  To reduce an algebraic fraction algebraic fraction reducing fraction reducing an algebraic fraction reducing fractions   Factor the numerator and the denominator.  Divide the numerator and denominator by any common factors.   Reduce each fraction.     We first factor the numerator and denominator completely. Then we divide numerator and denominator by the common factors 3 and . We must cancel the entire expression from numerator and denominator (we cannot cancel the 's or the 4's separately!). All the factors are canceled from the numerator, so we replace them by 1, because any expression divided by itself is 1.  The numerator of the fraction is a difference of two cubes, and the denominator is a difference of two squares. We factor each to obtain We cancel the factor from top and bottom, to get Because we cannot factor any further, we cannot reduce the fraction any further.   QuickCheck 2  Practice 4  Keep in mind that the reduced form is equivalent to the original form of the fraction. If we evaluate the original form and the reduced form at the same value of the variable, the results are equal.  Verify that is equal to for .  We evaluate each fraction at . and   Practice 5   Opposite of a Binomial binomial opposite of opposite of a binomial  Any number (except zero) divided by itself is 1, and any number divided by its opposite is . For example, The same is true for binomials and other algebraic expressions. The opposite of an expression can be found by multiplying it by . Thus, the opposite of is and so Here are some examples of opposites. We can cancel opposites when we reduce fractions.  Reduce    We first factor the numerator and denominator. We see that is the opposite of , that is, . Thus,   For more about the opposite of a binomial, see Section 8.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6   Rational Functions rational function function rational  Rational Function  A rational function rational function is a function defined by an algebraic fraction. That is, it has the form where and are polynomials. A rational function is undefined at any -values where .  Francine is planning a 60-mile training flight through the desert on her cycle-plane, a pedal-driven aircraft. If there is no wind, she can pedal at an average speed of 15 miles per hour, so she can complete the flight in 4 hours.  If there is a headwind of miles per hour, it will take Francine longer to fly 60 miles. Express the time it will take to complete the training flight as a function of .  Make a table of values for the function.  Graph the function and explain what it tells you about the time Francine should allot for the flight.    If there is a headwind of miles per hour, Francine's ground speed will be miles per hour. Using the fact that , we find that the time needed for the flight will be  We evaluate the function for several values of , as shown in the table below.                    For example, if the headwind is miles per hour, then Francine's effective speed is only 10 miles per hour, and it will take her 6 hours to fly the 60 miles. The table shows that as the speed of the headwind increases, the time required for the flight increases also.  The graph of the function is shown below. You can use your calculator with the window to verify the graph. In particular, the point lies on the graph. This point tells us that if there is no wind, Francine can fly 60 miles in 4 hours, as we calculated earlier.  graph showing time to complete trip vs speed of headwind  The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to 15 miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly 15 miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at .  What about negative values for ? If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine's flying time should decrease for negative -values. For example, if , there is a tailwind of 5 miles per hour, so Francine's effective speed is 20 miles per hour, and she can complete the flight in 3 hours. As the tailwind gets stronger (that is, as we move farther to the left in the -direction), Francine's flying time continues to decrease, and the graph approaches the -axis.   The vertical dashed line at on the graph of is a vertical asymptote asymptote vertical vertical asymptote for the graph. We first encountered asymptotes in when we studied the graph of . Locating the vertical asymptotes of a rational function is an important part of determining the shape of the graph.  Practice 7  Graph for part (c):   graph of average cost of production   In Practice 7 , the horizontal line is a horizontal asymptote asymptote horizontal horizontal asymptote for the graph of the function. As increases, the graph approaches the line but will never actually meet it. The average price per T-shirt will always be slightly more than $5. Horizontal asymptotes are also important in sketching the graphs of rational functions.  For more about asymptotes, see Section 8.2.3 of the Toolkit.

In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to 15 miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly 15 miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at .  What about negative values for ? If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine's flying time should decrease for negative -values.

Products of Fractions  To multiply two fractions together, we multiply their numerators together and then multiply their denominators together.  Product of Fractions product of fractions  If and , then  To see why this rule works, consider an example. Suppose you make a chocolate cake for the Math Club bake sale, but at the end of the day of the cake is left in the pan.

You cut the remaining cake into thirds, as shown in figure (b). How much of the original cake are you taking home? Your share is If you look at figure (b), you can see that you are taking home 8 pieces of cake, and that the original cake would have had 15 pieces of the same size. This means that your share is of the original cake.  We get the same answer if we use the rule above.  There is a shortcut for multiplying fractions that allows us to reduce the answer before we multiply. We do this by dividing out any common factors in a numerator and a denominator. For example, or   For more examples of multiplying fractions, see Section 8.3.1 of the Toolkit.  To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we write the whole number with 1 as denominator. The same applies to the product of an algebraic fraction and any nonfractional expression. For example,   Quotients of Fractions quotient of fractions fraction dividing  To divide one fraction by another, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. For example, We express this rule in symbols as follows.  Quotient of Fractions quotient of fractions fraction dividing  If , then  Why does this rule for division work? Consider a simple example, . This quotient asks us \"how many one-thirds are there in six?\" To see the answer, we can draw six whole units as shown below, and split each into thirds.   rectangles  Because there are 3 thirds in each whole unit, we find , or 18 thirds in six units. The answer is 18. Now, 3 is the reciprocal of , so by using the reciprocal rule, we also find  For a more interesting example, you might try using the figure above to show that (Hint: How many groups of two thirds can you make from six whole units?)  Thus, to divide two algebraic fractions, we take the reciprocal of the divisor (the second fraction) and then follow the rules for multiplying fractions.  For more examples of dividing fractions, see Section 8.3.2 of the Toolkit.   Using Factoring in Multiplication and Division  It is usually easier to cancel any common factors before multiplying. But be careful: if the numerators or denominators have more than one term, we'll need to factor them before looking for common factors!  Multiply  First, we factor each numerator and denominator. Then we divide numerator and denominator by any common factors.   canceling to reduce a fraction  In the previous Example, it would be incorrect to try to cancel any terms of numerators and denominators before factoring each binomial. For example, we cannot cancel into , because they are not factors of the fractions.  We summarize the procedure for multiplying algebraic fractions as follows.  To multiply algebraic fractions: algebraic fraction multiplying product of fractions fraction multiplying fraction multiplying muliplying algebraic fractions   Factor each numerator and denominator.  If any factor appears in both a numerator and a denominator, divide out that factor.  Multiply the remaining factors of the numerator and the remaining factors of the denominator.  Reduce the product if necessary.  Practice 1  The procedure for dividing fractions still applies: take the reciprocal of the second fraction, then follow the rules for multiplication.  Divide:  First, we change the operation to multiplication by taking the reciprocal of the second fraction. Now we follow the rules for multiplication: First, we factor each numerator and denominator.  We summarize the procedure for dividing algebraic fractions as follows.  To divide algebraic fractions: algebraic fraction dividing dividing algebraic fractions quotient of fractions fraction dividing   Take the reciprocal of the second fraction and change the operation to multiplication.  Follow the rules for multiplication of fractions.  Practice 2  For more examples of multiplying and dividing algebraic fractions, see Section 8.3.3 of the Toolkit.  When working with algebraic fractions, we often leave the denominators in factored form. This makes it easier to add and subtract fractions, and to check whether they can be reducecd.  QuickCheck 1   Adding and Subtracting Like Fractions fraction adding or subtracting like fractions adding or subtracting sum or difference of fractions  Fractions with the same denominator are called like fractions like fractions . For example, are like fractions, while are unlike fractions. We can add or subtract like fractions for the same reason that we can add like terms. Just as we can think of the sum as or . The denominators of the terms must be the same because they tell us what kind of quantity we are adding. We can add two quantities if they are the same kind.  When we add like fractions, we add their numerators and keep their denominators the same. For example, The same holds true for all algebraic fractions.  Sum or Difference of Like Fractions sum or difference of fractions fraction adding or subtracting like fractions like fractions adding or subtracting  If , then  Add.     Because these are like fractions, we add their numerators and keep the same denominator.  We combine the numerators over a single denominator.   We summarize our procedure for adding or subtracting like fractions as follows.  To add or subtract like fractions like fractions adding or subtracting fraction adding or subtracting like fractions sum or difference of fractions   Add or subtract the numerators.  Keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.  Practice 3  We must be careful when subtracting algebraic fractions: A subtraction sign in front of a fraction applies to the entire numerator.  Subtract:  We combine the numerators over a single denominator. We use parentheses around to show that the subtraction applies to the entire numerator. We should always check to see whether the fraction can be reduced. Factor the numerator to find   In the Example above, the subtraction symbol in the numerator applies to both terms of . That is why  QuickCheck 2  Practice 4   Unlike Fractions fraction unlike  Let's review the steps for adding or subtracting unlike fractions. For example, to compute the sum we first find the lowest common denominator lowest common denominator LCD lowest common denominator , or LCD , for the two fractions: The smallest number that is a multiple of both 3 and 4 is 12.  Next, we use the fundamental principle of fractions to build each fraction to an equivalent one with denominator 12. First, we multiply by . Because is equal to 1, we have not changed the value of the fraction. 4 is called the building factor building factor for . Similarly, we multiply by . There is nothing mysterious about the building process; we are breaking up each fraction into smaller pieces of the same size so that we can add them together.  subdivided rectangles  Finally, the new fractions are like fractions, and we can add them by combining their numerators. We add or subtract algebraic fractions with the same three steps.  To add or subtract algebraic fraction algebraic fraction adding or subtracting fraction adding or subtracting algebraic fractions sum or difference of fractions   Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.  Build each fraction to an equivalent one with the same denominator.  Add or subtract the resulting like fractions: Add or subtract their numerators, and keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.   Subtract:  Step 1: We find the LCD: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 15 is 30.  Step 2: We build each fraction to an equivalent one with denominator 30. The building factor for the first fraction is , and for the second fraction the building factor is .  Step 3: We subtract the resulting like fractions to obtain  Step 4: Finally, we reduce the fraction.   Practice 5  QuickCheck 3   Finding the Lowest Common Denominator  The lowest common denominator lowest common denominator fraction lowest common denominator lowest common denominator for two or more algebraic fractions is the simplest algebraic expression that is a multiple of each denominator. If neither denominator can be factored, then their LCD is just the product of the two expressions.  Add:   Step 1: The LCD for these fractions is just the product of their denominators, .  Step 2: We build each fraction to an equivalent one with denominator . The building factor for is and the building factor for is . We multiply numerator and denominator of each fraction by its building factor.  Step 3: We combine the resulting like fractions.  Step 4: The numerator of this fraction cannot be factored, so the sum cannot be reduced.  Practice 6  If the denominators contain any common factors, the LCD is not simply their product. For example, the LCD for is not . It is true that 216 is a multiple of both 12 and 18, but it is not the smallest one! We can find a smaller common denominator by factoring each denominator. To find a number that both 12 and 18 divide into evenly, we need only enough factors to cover each of them. In this case two 2's and two 3's are sufficient, so the LCD is You can check that both 12 and 18 divide evenly into 36.  In general, we can find the LCD in the following way.  To Find the LCD lowest common denominator finding the   Factor each denominator completely.  Include each different factor in the LCD as many times as it occurs in any one of the given denominators.   Find the LCD for the fractions and   We factor the denominators of each of the given fractions. The factor occurs once in the first denominator, the factor occurs once in the second denominator, and the factor occurs once in each denominator. Therefore we include in our LCD one copy of each of these factors. The LCD is .   For more on finding the LCD, see Section 8.3.4 of the Toolkit.  In the previous Example, we do not include two factors of in the LCD. We need only one factor of , because occurs only once in each denominator. You can check that each original denominator divides evenly into our LCD, .  Practice 7   Adding and Subtracting Unlike Fractions fraction adding or subtracting unlike fractions  After finding the LCD, we build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as its denominator. The new fractions will be like fractions, so we can combine their numerators.  Building a fraction is an application of the fundamental principle of fractions, It is the opposite of reducing a fraction, because we multiply, rather than divide, the numerator and denominator by an appropriate factor. To find the building factor building factor fraction building factor , we compare the factors of the original denominator with those of the desired common denominator.  Add:    Step 1: Find the LCD. We factor each denominator completely. The LCD is .  Step 2: We build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as its denominator. The building factor for is . We multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by : The building factor for is .  Step 3: The fractions are now like fractions, so we add them by combining their numerators.  Step 4: Finally, we reduce the fraction.   For more help with building, see Section 8.3.5 of the Toolkit.  Do not reduce the built-up fractions in Step 3 -- you will just get back to the original problem. When adding fractions, we have to make the fractions \"harder\" before we can combine them. Don't reduce until the last step of the problem.  QuickCheck 4  Practice 8   Applications  Recall that the formulas for rational functions are algebraic fractions. It is often useful to simplify the formula for a function before using it.  When estimating their travel time, pilots must take into account the prevailing winds. A tail wind adds to the plane's ground speed, while a head wind decreases the ground speed. Skyhigh Airlines is setting up a shuttle service from Dallas to Phoenix, a distance of 800 miles.  Express the time needed for a one-way trip, without wind, as a function of the speed of the plane.  Suppose there is a prevailing wind of 30 miles per hour blowing from the west. Write expressions for the flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Dallas.  Write an expression for the round trip flying time with a 30-mile-per-hour wind from the west, as a function of the plane's speed. Simplify your expression.   Recall that . If we let represent the speed of the plane in still air, then the time required for a one-way trip is  On the trip from Dallas to Phoenix the plane encounters a head wind of 30 miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is . On the return trip the plan enjoys a tail wind of 30 miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is . Therefore, the flying times are  The round-trip flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and back is The LCD for these fractions is . Thus,  Practice 9    Problem Set 8.3  Warm Up  In Problems 1 6, we review the operations on arithmetic fractions.                                              Skills Practice  Multiply.

  "body": "More Operations on Fractions  In this section we consider a few more skills for working with algebraic fractions.  Complex Fractions complex fraction fraction complex  A fraction that contains one or more fractions in either its numerator or its denominator or both is called a complex fraction complex fraction . For example, are complex fractions. Like simple fractions, complex fractions represent quotients. For the examples above, and We can always simplify a complex fraction into a standard algebraic fraction. One way to do this is to treat the fraction as a division.  Simplify  First, Write the complex fraction as a quotient. Invert the divisor and multiply.   Practice 1  If the numerator or denominator of the complex fraction contains more than one term, there is an easier way to simplify the fraction. This method takes advantage of the fundamental principle of fractions.  Simplify  This complex fraction contains the simple fractions and . The LCD of these fractions is . We multiply the numerator and denominator of the complex fraction by . Doing this will not change the value of the fraction, but will clear all the \"smaller\" fractions inside. Then we apply the distributive law, so that we multiply each term of the numerator and each term of the denominator by . Finally, we reduce the result to obtain   We summarize the procedure for simplifying complex fractions as follows.  To simplify a complex fraction complex fraction simplify fraction complex fraction simplify simplifying a complex fraction   Find the LCD of all the fractions contained in the complex fraction.  Multiply the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction by the LCD.  Reduce the resulting simple fraction, if possible.   Practice 2   Negative Exponents negative exponents  Algebraic fractions are sometimes written using negative exponents.  Write each expression as a single algebraic fraction.       We write each power as a fraction, then simplify.  We simplify the expression inside parentheses first. For the last step, remember that a negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of its base.   To review negative exponents, see Section 8.4.1 of the Toolkit.  When working with fractions and exponents, it is important to avoid some tempting but incorrect algebraic operations.  In part (a) of , note that For example, you can check that, for and ,  In part (b) of , note that The fourth law of exponents does not apply to sums and differences; that is,  Practice 3  QuickCheck 1   Applications  Sometimes mathematics can help us solve problems when our intuition fails us or leads us astray.  On a weekday afternoon, when traffic is always horrible, Kathy left her home north of Los Angeles and drove south 120 miles along the San Diego Freeway to San Juan Capistrano. Her average speed was 40 miles per hour. She returned home on Saturday, at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. What was her average speed for the round trip?  If you said that the average speed is 50 miles per hour, you would be wrong! Let's do some calculations. Kathy's average speed for the round trip is given by The total distance she drove is 240 miles, but to find the total time we must compute the time Kathy drove on each part of the trip. We use the formula and solve for .         Driving south      Driving north      The total time for the round trip was hours, so Kathy's average speed was   Why does the average speed turn out to be less than 50 miles per hour? Because Kathy spent more time driving at 40 miles per hour (3 hours) than she did driving at 60 miles per hour (2 hours).  By generalizing the problem above we can find an algebraic formula for the average speed on a two-part trip. Suppose the distance traveled on the two parts of the trip are and , and the corresponding speeds on the two parts are and . We fill in the table to find the time required for each part.     Distance  Rate  Time   First part      Second part      The total distance traveled on the trip is , and the total time required is Thus, the average speed for the entire trip is  Practice 4   Polynomial Division polynomial division  Consider three improper fractions: and . Can these fractions be simplified?  We can reduce the first fraction:  The second fraction reduces to a whole number:  The third fraction does not reduce, but by dividing the denominator into the numerator, we can write it as a whole number plus a proper fraction:  An algebraic fraction is \"improper\" if the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. If it cannot be reduced, we can simplify the expression by treating it as a division of polynomials. The quotient will be the sum of a polynomial and a simpler algebraic fraction.  To review improper fractions, see Section 8.4.2 of the Toolkit.  If the divisor is a monomial, we can simply divide the monomial into each term of the numerator.  Divide  We divide into each term of the numerator. Note that the quotient is the sum of a polynomial, , and an algebraic fraction, .  Practice 5  If the denominator is not a monomial, we use a method similar to the long division algorithm used in arithmetic.  Divide   We first write the quotient as a division problem: and divide (the first term of the numerator) by (the first term of the denominator) to obtain . (It may be helpful to write down the division: .) We write above the quotient bar as the first term of the quotient, as shown below.  Next, we multiply by to obtain , and subtract this product from : Repeating the process, we divide by to obtain . We write as the second term of the quotient. Then we multiply by to obtain , and subtract: Because the degree of the remainder, 8, is less than the degree of , the division is finished. The quotient is , with a remainder of . We write the remainder as a fraction to obtain   To check a polynomial division, see Section 8.4.3 of the Toolkit.  When using polynomial division, it helps to write the polynomials in descending powers of the variable. If the numerator is missing any terms, we can insert terms with zero coefficients so that like powers will be aligned. For example, to perform the division we first write the numerator in descending powers as . We insert between and and set up the quotient as We then proceed as in . You can check that the quotient is  Practice 6  QuickCheck 2    Problem Set 8.4  Warm Up   Add  Subtract  Multiply  Divide    Skills Practice  For Problems 5 16, simplify the complex fraction.

  "body": "Equations with Fractions equation with fractions    graph of rational function for solving equation  In of Section 8.2 Francine planned a 60-mile training run on her cycle-plane. The time required for the training run, in terms of the windspeed, , is given by: If it takes Francine 9 hours to cover 60 miles, what is the speed of the wind? We can answer this question by reading values from the graph of , as shown at left. When , the value of is between 8 and 9, so the windspeed is between 8 and 9 miles per hour.   Solving Algebraically  If we need a more accurate value for the windspeed, we can solve the equation To start, we multiply each side of the equation by the denominator of the fraction. This will clear the fraction and give us an equivalent equation without fractions.  Solve the equation  We multiply both sides of the equation by to obtain From here we can proceed as usual. The windspeed was , or miles per hour.  Practice 1  If the equation contains more than one fraction, we can clear all the denominators at once by multiplying both sides by the LCD of the fractions. lowest common denominator clearing fractions with  Solve  The LCD for the two fractions in the equation is . We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD. We proceed as usual to complete the solution. First we use the distributive law to remove parentheses. The solution is .  We must multiply each term of an equation by the LCD, whether or not the term is a fraction. In the previous Example we multiplied each term by the LCD, including the 8.  Practice 2   Proportions proportion  A proportion  proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. For example, To solve this proportion, we can multiply both sides by the LCD, 30, to get  There is a short-cut we can use that avoids calculating an LCD. Observe that we can arrive at the equation by cross-multiplying cross-multiplying proportion proportion cross-multiplying :  cross-multiplying  We then proceed as before to complete the solution.  The cross-multiplying shortcut is a fundamental property of proportions.  Property of Proportions property of proportions proportion cross-multiplying    The scale on a map of Fairfield County says that centimeter represents a distance of 10 kilometers. If Eastlake and Kenwood are 6 centimeters apart on the map, what is the distance between the two towns?  The ratio of the two actual distances is the same as the ratio of the corresponding distances on the map. We let stand for the distance between Eastlake and Kenwood, and write a proportion.  We must be careful to keep the same order in both ratios. We choose to put the distance between towns in the numerators, and the distances on the scale in the denominator. To solve the propotion, we cross-multiply. The two towns are 80 kilometers apart.  Practice 3  Do not try to use \"cross-multiplying\" on equations that are not proportions, or on any other operations involving fractions. The shortcut works only on proportions.  QuickCheck 1   Extraneous Solutions  Recall that an algebraic fraction is undefined for any values of that make its denominator equal zero. These values cannot be solutions to equations involving the fraction. Consider the equation When we multiply both sides by the LCD, , we obtain whose solution is . However, is not a solution of the original equation. Both sides of the equation are undefined at . If you graph the two functions you will find that the graphs never intersect, which means that there is no solution to the original equation.  What went wrong with our method of solution? We multiplied both sides of the equation by , which is zero when , so we really multiplied both sides of the equation by zero. Multiplying by zero does not produce an equivalent equation, and false solutions may be introduced.  An apparent solution that does not satisfy the original equation is called an extraneous solution extraneous solution . Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solution obtained does not cause any of the fractions to be undefined.  Solve the equation .  We multiply both sides by the LCD, . Notice that we multiply each term on the left side by the LCD, to get or We use the distributive law to remove the parentheses and write the result in standard form: This is a quadratic equation that we can solve by factoring.  so the solutions are and . Neither of these values causes either denominator to equal zero, so they are not extraneous solutions.  To review solving quadratic equations, see Section 8.5.1 of the Toolkit.  The following \"solution\" for the previous Example is incorrect. Do you see why?  QuickCheck 2  Practice 4   Solving Graphically  We can use graphs to solve an equation, as we see in the following Example.  Solve the equation graphically:   We graph the two functions in the window as shown in figure (a).  GC images of intersecting rational functions  It appears that the two graphs may intersect in the third quadrant, around . To investigate further, we change the window settings to and obtain the close-up view shown in figure (b). In this window, we can see that the graphs intersect in two distinct points, and by using the Trace we find that their -coordinates are and .  To review solving equations graphically, see Section 8.5.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 5  Graph for (a):  graph    Applications  Application problems may lead to equations with algebraic fractions.  Rani times herself as she kayaks 30 miles down the Derwent River with the help of the current. Returning upstream against the current, she manages only 18 miles in the same amount of time. Rani knows that she can kayak at a rate of 12 miles per hour in still water. What is the speed of the current?  If we let represent the speed of the current, we can use the formula to fill in the following table.     Distance  Rate  Time   Downstream      Upstream      Because Rani paddled for equal amounts of time upstream and downstream, we have the equation The LCD for the fractions in this equation is . We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to obtain Solving this equation, we find The speed of the current is 3 miles per hour.  We can solve the equation in graphically by considering two functions, one for each side of the equation. Graph the two functions in the window to obtain the graph shown below.  intersecting rational functions  The function gives the time it takes Rani to paddle 30 miles downstream, and gives the time it takes her to paddle 18 miles upstream. Both of these times depend on the speed of the current, .  We are looking for a value of that makes and equal. This occurs at the intersection point of the two graphs, . Thus, the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour, as we found in . The y-coordinate of the intersection point gives the time Rani paddled on each part of her trip: 2 hours each way.  Practice 6   Formulas  Algebraic fractions may appear in formulas that relate several variables. If we want to solve for one variable in terms of the others, we may need to clear the fractions.  Solve the formula for .  Because the variable we want appears in the denominator, we must first multiply both sides of the equation by that denominator, . We apply the distributive law on the left side, then collect all terms that involve on one side of the equation. We cannot combine the two terms containing because they are not like terms. However, we can factor out , so that the right side is written as a single term containing the variable . We can then complete the solution.   Practice 7  QuickCheck 3   Summary  In this chapter we have learned a number of algebraic skills to deal with fractions. Here are the operations we studied:  reducing fractions  multiplying and dividing fractions  adding and subtracting fractions  simplifying complex fractions  polynomial division  solving equations with fractions   Each type of operation has a particular method, and it may help to review which method to use on each type of operation.

The coefficient of the highest power term is called the lead coefficient lead coefficient .  Degree of a Product  The degree of a product of non-zero polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the factors. That is:  If has degree and has degree , then their product has degree .  Special Products of Binomials   Cube of a Binomial     Factoring the Sum or Difference of Two Cubes      Fundamental Principle of Fractions  We can multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero factor, and the new fraction will be equivalent to the old one.  When we cancel common factors, we are dividing . Because division is the inverse or opposite operation for multiplication, we can cancel common factors , but we cannot cancel common terms .  To reduce an algebraic fraction   Factor the numerator and the denominator.  Divide the numerator and denominator by any common factors.  Rational Function  A rational function has the form where and are polynomials. A rational function is undefined at any -values where .  Operations on Fractions  If , then  If , then  If , then   To multiply algebraic fractions:   Factor each numerator and denominator.  If any factor appears in both a numerator and a denominator, divide out that factor.  Multiply the remaining factors of the numerator and the remaining factors of the denominator.  Reduce the product if necessary.  To divide algebraic fractions:   Take the reciprocal of the second fraction and change the operation to multiplication.  Follow the rules for multiplication of fractions.  To add or subtract algebraic fractions   Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.  Build each fraction to an equivalent one with the same denominator.  Add or subtract the resulting like fractions: Add or subtract their numerators, and keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.  To Find the LCD   Factor each denominator completely.  Include each different factor in the LCD as many times as it occurs in any one of the given denominators.  To simplify a complex fraction   Find the LCD of all the fractions contained in the complex fraction.  Multiply the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction by the LCD.  Reduce the resulting simple fraction, if possible.  An algebraic fractrion is \"improper\" if the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. If it cannot be reduced, we can simplify the expression by treating it as a division of polynomials. The quotient will be the sum of a polynomial and a simpler algebraic fraction.  If an equation contains more than one fraction, we can clear all the denominators at once by multiplying both sides by the LCD of the fractions.  Property of Proportions    Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solution obtained does not cause any of the fractions to be undefined.

  "body": "Properties of Lines  So far we have used linear equations to model variables that increase or decrease at a constant rate, and, of course, their graphs are straight lines. In this chapter we'll study the connections between some basic geometric shapes and their algebraic equations, starting with straight lines.  Horizontal and Vertical Lines  In Section 1.5 we learned that the general form for a linear equation is What happens if ? For example, what does the graph of look like? This equation tells us that every point on the line must have -coordinate 3, but it puts no restrictions on the -coordinates. For example, are all solutions of the equation. These points lie on a horizontal line, as shown below left.   horizontal line  vertical line  On the other hand, if , we have an equation such as This equation tells us that any point with -coordinate lies on the graph. For example, and are solutions. All the solutions lie on the vertical line shown above right.  Note that the horizontal line has -intercept y -intercept  but no -intercept, and the vertical line has -intercept x -intercept  but no -intercept.  Horizontal and Vertical Lines horizontal line vertical line   The equation of the horizontal line horizontal line passing through is  The equation of the vertical line vertical line line vertical passing through is   Give the equation of each line.  horizontal line  horizontal line    This is a horizontal line with -intercept , so its equation is .  This is a vertical line with -intercept , so its equation is .   Now let's compute the slopes of the two lines in the previous Example .  To review computing slope, see Section 9.1.1 of the Toolkit. We choose two points on the graph of , say and , and use these points to compute the slope. The slope of the horizontal line is zero. In fact, the slope of any horizontal line is zero, because the -coordinates of all the points on the line are equal. Thus, for any horizontal line  On a vertical line, the -coordinates of all the points are equal. For example, two points on the line are and . Using these points to compute the slope, we find which is undefined. The slope of any vertical line is undefined because the expression equals zero.  Slopes of Horizontal and Vertical Lines horizontal line slope of vertical line slope of slope undefined slope zero  The slope of a horizontal line horizontal line is zero .  The slope of a vertical line vertical line is undefined .   Practice 1  QuickCheck 1   Parallel and Perpendicular Lines   Lines that lie in the same plane but never intersect are called parallel parallel lines line parallel lines. They have the same \"steepness\" or inclination, so it is easy to understand that parallel lines have the same slope. You can verify that the parallel lines in the figure at right both have slope  parallel lines   perpendicular lines  Perpendicular perpendicular lines line perpendicular lines in a plane meet at right angles, or 90°. The relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines is not so easy to see as the relationship for parallel lines. However, for the perpendicular lines shown at left, you can verify that  Note that the product of and is , that is, This relationship holds for any pair of perpendicular lines. We summarize these results as follows.  Parallel and Perpendicular Lines   Two lines are parallel parallel lines line parallel if their slopes are equal, that is, if or if both lines are vertical.  Two lines are perpendicular perpendicular lines line perpendicular if the product of their slopes is , that is, if or if one of the lines is horizontal and one is vertical.   Another way to state the condition for perpendicular lines is Because of this relationship, we often say that the slope of one perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal negative reciprocal of the other.  Decide whether the lines are parallel, perpendicular, or neither.  We could graph the lines, but we can't be sure from a graph if the lines are exactly parallel or exactly perpendicular. A more accurate way to settle the question is to find the slope of each line. To do this we write each equation in slope-intercept form; that is, we solve for . The slope of the first line is , and the slope of the second line is . The slopes are not equal, so the lines are not parallel. However, the product of the slopes is so the lines are perpendicular.  Practice 2  QuickCheck 2   Applications to Geometry  These relationships for the slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines can help us solve numerous geometric problems.  Show that the triangle with vertices , , and is a right triangle.  We will show that two of the sides of the right triangle are perpendicular. The line segment has slope   and the segment has slope Because  triangle  The sides and perpendicular, and therefore the triangle is a right triangle.   For more examples of geometric problems, see Section 9.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3  Find an equation for the line that passes through the point and is perpendicular to the line .   First we find the slope of the desired line, then use the point-slope formula to write its equation. The line we want is perpendicular to the given line, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of , the slope of the given line. Thus  line perpendicular to given line  Now we use the point-slope formula with and . The given line and the perpendicular line are shown in the figure above.  To review the point-slope formula, see Section 9.1.2 of the Toolkit.

  "body": " From straight lines we can build triangles and other polygons. For curves, the simplest figure is a circle, so we'll consider circles next. You know that a circle is the set of all points in a plane at the same distance from the the center of the circle, so our first task will be to develop a formula for the distance between two points.  The Distance and Midpoint Formulas  Distance in a Coordinate Plane  Figure (a) shows a line segment joining the two points and . What is the distance between the two points?   line segment in coordinate plane   line segment as hypotenuse  Definition  The distance between two points is the length of the segment joining them.   If we make a right triangle as shown in Figure (b), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find its length. First, notice that the coordinates at the right angle are . We can find the lengths of the two legs of the triangle, because they are horizontal and vertical segments. The segment we want is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, so we apply the Pythagorean theorem.   The Distance Formula  We can also use the Pythagorean theorem to derive a formula for the distance between any two points, and , in terms of their coordinates. We first label a right triangle, as we did in the discussion above. Draw a horizontal line through and a vertical line through .  These lines meet at a point , as shown in the figure below. The -coordinate of is the same as the -coordinate of , and the -coordinate of is the same as the -coordinate of . Thus, the coordinates of are .  distance between two points in the plane  The distance between and is , and the distance between and is . These two numbers are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle. The length of the hypotenuse is the distance between and , which we'll call . By the Pythagorean theorem, Taking the (positive) square root of each side of this equation gives us the distance formula distance formula .  Distance Formula distance formula  The distance  between points and is   QuickCheck 1  Find the distance between and .  Substitute for and for in the distance formula to obtain  To review working with radicals, see Section 9.2.1 of the Toolkit.  It doesn't matter which point we call and which is . We obtain the same answer in the previous Example if we switch the two points and use for and for :  We cannot simplify as . Remember that . You can easily see this by observing that so it cannot be true that equals , or 7. For the same reason, we cannot simplify the distance formula to .  Practice 1 Graph for Practice 1:  distance formula   The Midpoint Formula  The midpoint midpoint of a segment is the point halfway between its endpoints, so that the distance from the midpoint to either endpoint is the same.  The -coordinate of the midpoint is halfway between the -coordinates of the endpoints, and likewise for the -coordinate. For the points and shown below, the -coordinate of the midpoint is , which is halfway between and . The -coordinate is halfway between and , or . Thus, the midpoint is .  line segment  If we know the coordinates of two points, we can calculate the coordinates of the midpoint. Each coordinate of the midpoint is the average of the corresponding coordinates of the two points.  Midpoint Formula  The midpoint midpoint of the line segment joining the points and is the point , where   Find the midpoint of the line segment joining the points and .  We substitute for and for in the midpoint formula to obtain The midpoint of the segment is the point .  Practice 2  Graph for Practice 2:  rectangle    Circles  A circle circle is the set of all points in a plane that lie at a given distance, called the radius radius , from a fixed point called the center center of a circle circle center . We can use the distance formula to find an equation for a circle. First consider the circle in Figure (a), whose center is the origin, .  circles  The distance from the origin to any point on the circle is . Therefore, or, squaring both sides, Thus, the equation for a circle of radius centered at the origin is  Now consider the circle in Figure (b), whose center is the point . Every point on the circle lies a distance from , so the equation of the circle is given by the following formula.  Standard Form for a Circle circle equation of circle radius circle center radius radius circle  The equation for a circle of radius centered at the point is   Find a point with -coordinate that lies on the circle .   We substitute into the equation, and solve for . We see that the solutions are and . Thus, the points and lie on the circle.  For more examples using the equation of a circle, see Section 9.2.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 3  It is easy to graph a circle if its equation is given in standard form.  Graph the circles.      The graph of is a circle with radius 4 and center at . To sketch the graph, we first locate the center of the circle. (The center is not part of the graph of the circle.)  From the center, we move a distance of 4 units (the radius of the circle) in each of four directions: up, down, left, and right. This locates four points that lie on the circle: , , , and . We sketch the circle through these four points.  circles  The graph of is a circle with radius and center at . From the center, we move approximately , or 2.6 units in each of the four coordinate directions to obtain the points , , , and . We sketch the circle through these four points.   Practice 4  circle  We can write an equation for any circle if we can find its center and radius.  Find an equation for the circle whose diameter has endpoints and .    The center of the circle is the midpoint of its diameter. We use the midpoint formula to find the center: Thus, the center is the point .  circle with diameter (7,5) to (1,-1)  The radius is the distance from the center to either of the endpoints of the diameter, say the point . We use the distance formula with the points and to find the radius. Finally, we substitute 4 for and 2 for (the coordinates of the center) and for (the radius) into the standard form to obtain  Practice 5   General Form for Circles  The equations of circles often appear in a general quadratic form general quadratic form of a circle circle general quadratic form , rather than the standard form described above. For example, we can expand the squares of binomials in part (a) of the previous Example, to obtain or  This is a quadratic equation in two variables. Such an equation describes a circle if the coefficients of the quadratic, or squared, terms are equal.  Conversely, an equation of the form can be converted to standard form by completing the square completing the square in both variables. Once this is done, the center and radius of the circle can be determined directly from the equation.  Write the equation of the circle in standard form, and graph the equation.  We prepare to complete the square in both variables by writing the equation as We complete the square in by adding 16 to each side of the equation, and complete the square in by adding 1 to each side, to get   from which we obtain the standard form, Thus, the circle has its center at , and its radius is , or approximately 3.3. The graph is shown at right.  circle   To review completing the square, see Section 9.2.3 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 4  Practice 6   Investigation  Global Positioning  The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used by hikers, pilots, surveyors, automobiles to determine their location (latitude, longitude, and elevation) anywhere on the surface of the earth. The system depends on a collection of satellites in orbit around the earth. Each GPS satellite transmits its own position and the current time at regular intervals.  A person with a GPS receiver on earth can calculate his or her distance from the satellite by comparing the time of transmission with the time when it receives the signal. Of course, there are many points at the same distance from the satellite—in fact, the set of all points at a certain distance from the satellite lie on a sphere centered at the satellite. That is why there are several satellites: You calculate your position by finding the intersection point of several such spheres centered on different satellites.  We will consider a simplified, two-dimensional model of a GPS system in which the satellites and the receiver all lie in the -plane instead of in three-dimensional space.  In this model we’ll need data from two GPS satellites. The satellites are orbiting along a circle of radius 100 meters centered at the origin. You have a receiver inside that circle and would like to know the coordinates of your position within the circle.  grid  To make the computations simpler, we will also assume that the satellite transmissions travel at 5 meters per second.   A signal from Satellite A arrives 18 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite A?  The signal says that Satellite A was located at at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite A.   Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (2).  A signal from Satellite B arrives 8.4 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite B?  The signal says that Satellite B was located at at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite B.  Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (5).  Your position must lie at the intersection point, , of your two graphs. Estimate the coordinates of your position from the graph. (Remember that you are within the orbits of the satellites.)  Later in this chapter you will learn how to find the coordinates of algebraically by solving a system of equations. Verify that the ordered pairs and both satisfy the equations you wrote in part (3) and part (6). What are the coordinates of ?

  "body": "Global Positioning  The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used by hikers, pilots, surveyors, automobiles to determine their location (latitude, longitude, and elevation) anywhere on the surface of the earth. The system depends on a collection of satellites in orbit around the earth. Each GPS satellite transmits its own position and the current time at regular intervals.  A person with a GPS receiver on earth can calculate his or her distance from the satellite by comparing the time of transmission with the time when it receives the signal. Of course, there are many points at the same distance from the satellite—in fact, the set of all points at a certain distance from the satellite lie on a sphere centered at the satellite. That is why there are several satellites: You calculate your position by finding the intersection point of several such spheres centered on different satellites.  We will consider a simplified, two-dimensional model of a GPS system in which the satellites and the receiver all lie in the -plane instead of in three-dimensional space.  In this model we’ll need data from two GPS satellites. The satellites are orbiting along a circle of radius 100 meters centered at the origin. You have a receiver inside that circle and would like to know the coordinates of your position within the circle.  grid  To make the computations simpler, we will also assume that the satellite transmissions travel at 5 meters per second.   A signal from Satellite A arrives 18 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite A?  The signal says that Satellite A was located at at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite A.   Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (2).  A signal from Satellite B arrives 8.4 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite B?  The signal says that Satellite B was located at at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite B.  Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (5).  Your position must lie at the intersection point, , of your two graphs. Estimate the coordinates of your position from the graph. (Remember that you are within the orbits of the satellites.)  Later in this chapter you will learn how to find the coordinates of algebraically by solving a system of equations. Verify that the ordered pairs and both satisfy the equations you wrote in part (3) and part (6). What are the coordinates of ?  "

A second-degree equation in two variables has the general form where , , and cannot all be zero (because in that case the equation would not be second degree). The graphs of such equations are curves called conic sections conic section because they are formed by the intersection of a plane and a cone, as illustrated below. Except for a few special cases called degenerate conics degenerate conic , the conic sections fall into four categories called circles circle , ellipses ellipse , hyperbolas hyperbola , and parabolas parabola .  conics  Conic sections whose centers (or vertices, in the case of parabolas) are located at the origin are called central conics central conic .   Circles and Ellipses  The circle is the most familiar of the conic sections. Recall that the standard equation for a circle of radius, , centered at the point is: and a circle whose center is the origin has equation If we divide through by , we can also write this equation in the form Notice that the denominators of both the - and -terms are . You can check that the - and -intercepts of this circle are and .  If the denominators of the -squared and -squared terms are not equal, the graph is called an ellipse ellipse . An ellipse is an elongated circle, or oval. Ellipses appear in a variety of applications. The orbits of the planets and of satellites about the earth are ellipses. The arches in some bridges are elliptical in shape, and whispering domes, such as the ceiling of the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, are made from ellipses.  A circle is defined as the set of all points in a plane that lie at a fixed distance from its center. An ellipse also has a geometric definition.  Ellipse ellipse  An ellipse ellipse is the set of points in the plane, the sum of whose distances from two fixed points (the foci ellipse foci focus of an ellipse ) is a constant.   Using the distance formula and the definition above, we can show that the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin has the following standard form.  Central Ellipse ellipse central ellipse ellipse central center of an ellipse  The equation of an ellipse centered at the origin is   By setting equal to zero in the equation above, we find that the -intercepts of this ellipse are and ; by setting equal to zero, we find that the -intercepts are and .

  "body": "Conic Sections: Hyperbolas hyperbola   If a cone is cut by a plane parallel to its axis, the intersection is a hyperbola hyperbola , the only conic section conic section made of two separate pieces, or branches branches hyperbola hyperbola branches . Hyperbolas occur in a number of applied settings. The navigational system called LORAN (long-range navigation) uses radio signals to locate a ship or plane at the intersection of two hyperbolas. Satellites moving with sufficient speed will follow an orbit that is branch of a hyperbola; for example, a rocket sent to the moon must be fitted with retrorockets to reduce its speed in order to achieve an elliptical, rather than hyperbolic, orbit about the moon.  The hyperbola is defined as follows.  Hyperbola hyperbola  A hyperbola hyperbola is the set of points in the plane, the difference of whose distances from two fixed points (the foci focus of a hyperbola ) is a constant.    hyperbola with horizontal transverse axis  hyperbola with vertical transverse axis  If the origin is the center of the hyperbola and the foci (labeled and on the graphs above) lie on the axes, we can use the distance formula to derive its equation.  Central Hyperbola hyperbola central center of hyperbola central hyperbola  The equation of a hyperbola with center at the origin is   In the first case, the two branches of the hyperbola open left and right, so the graph has -intercepts at and but no -intercepts. (See figure above left.) The segment joining the -intercepts is the transverse axis axis transverse hyperbola transverse axis transverse axis hyperbola , and its length is . The endpoints of the transverse axis are the vertices hyperbola vertices vertex of a hyperbola vertices hyperbola of the hyperbola. The segment of length is called the conjugate axis. conjugate axis conjugate axis hyperbola axis conjugate hyperbola conjugate axis  In the second case, the graph has -intercepts at and but no -intercepts the two branches open up and down. (See figure above right.) Here the -intercepts are the vertices, so the transverse axis is vertical and has length . The conjugate axis has length .   Asymptotes of Hyperbolas  The branches of the hyperbola approach two straight lines that intersect at its center. These lines are asymptotes asymptote of hyperbola hyperbola asymptotes of the graph, and they are useful as guidelines for sketching the hyperbola. We first sketch a rectangle (called the central rectangle central rectangle ) whose sides are parallel to the axes and whose dimensions are and . The asymptotes are the diagonals of this rectangle.  Graph  The graph is a hyperbola with center at the origin. The -term is positive, so the branches of the hyperbola open upward and downward. Because and , we have and , and the vertices are and .

We have already encountered parabolas in our study of quadratic functions. In particular, the graph of has its vertex at the origin and opens up or down, depending on the sign of . The graph of is a parabola that opens to the left or right. There is also a geometric definition of a parabola, but we will not discuss that here.  table summarizing conics   Write each equation in standard form and describe its graph.

Practice 4   Translated Hyperbolas  The standard form for the equations of hyperbolas centered at the point can be derived using the distance formula and the definition of hyperbola.  Hyperbolas hyperbola translated center of hyperbola  The equation for a hyperbola centered at has one of the two standard forms:   The first equation describes a hyperbola whose transverse axis is parallel to the -axis, so that the branches open left and right, and the second equation describes a hyperbola whose transverse axis is parallel to the -axis, so that the branches open up and down, as shown below.   hyperbola-left-and-right-translated    hyperbola-up-and-down-translated   Graph  Find the equations of the asymptotes.

We draw the asymptotes through the opposite corners of the central rectangle, and sketch the hyperbola through the vertices and approaching the asymptotes to obtain the graph shown above.  Both asymptotes pass through the center of the hyperbola, . Their slopes are We substitute these values into the point-slope formula to find the equations   For more help finding the equations of the asyptotes, see Section 9.4.3 of the Toolkit.

Practice 6  :  translated hyperbola opening left and right    QuickCheck 2   General Quadratic Equation in Two Variables  We have considered graphs of second-degree equations in two variables, for which , the coefficient of the -term, is zero. These graphs are conic sections with axes parallel to one or both of the coordinate axes. If does not equal zero, the axes of the conic section are rotated with respect to the coordinate axes. The graphing of such equations is taken up in more advanced courses in analytic geometry.  The graph of a second-degree equation can also be a point, a line, a pair of lines, or no graph at all, depending on the values of the coefficients through . Such graphs are called degenerate conics degenerate conic conic section degenerate .  Given an equation of the form we can determine the nature of the graph from the coefficients of the quadratic terms. If the graph is not a degenerate conic, the following criteria apply.  Conic Sections conic section  The graph of is  a circle if .  a parabola if or (but not both).  an ellipse if and have the same sign.  a hyperbola if and have opposite signs.   Name the graph of each equation, assuming that the graph is not degenerate.       The graph is a circle because the coefficients of and are equal.  The graph is an ellipse because the coefficients of and are both positive.  The graph is a hyperbola because the coefficients of and have opposite signs.  The graph is a parabola because is of first degree and is of second degree.   The standard forms for the conic sections conic section standard form are summarized in the table below. For the parabola, is the vertex of the graph, and for the other conics, is the center. circle ellipse hyperbola parabola  table of conic sections   The coefficients , , and do not figure in determining the type of conic section the equation represents. They do, however, determine the position of the graph relative to the origin. Once we recognize the form of the graph, we can write the equation in standard form in order to discover more information about the graph.

This is also true of systems in which one or both of the equations is quadratic. The figure below shows the three cases for systems of one quadratic and one linear equation.  graphs of 3 cases for quadratic system  In the next Example, we use both graphical and algebraic techniques to solve the system.  For more examples of problems that can be solved with a system of equations, see Section 9.5.1 of the Toolkit.  The Pizza Connection calculates that the cost, in dollars, of producing pizzas per day is given by The Pizza Connection charges $15 per pizza, so the revenue from selling pizzas is How many pizzas per day must the Pizza Connection sell in order to break even?  To break even means to make zero profit. Because the break-even points occur when revenue equals cost. In mathematical terms, we would like to find any values of for which . If we graph the revenue and cost functions on the same axes, these values correspond to points where the two graphs intersect. Use the WINDOW settings on your calculator to obtain the graph shown below. You can verify that the two intersection points are and .  GC figure for quadratic system  Thus, the Pizza Connection must sell either 15 or 80 pizzas in order to break even. On the graph we see that revenue is greater than cost for -values between 15 and 80, so the Pizza Connection will make a profit if it sells between 15 and 80 pizzas.  We can also solve algebraically for the break-even points. The intersection points of the two graphs correspond to the solutions of the system of equations We equate the two expressions for and solve for :  The solutions are 15 and 80, as we found from the graph.  Practice 1  Graph of system:  parabola and line   What about a system of two quadratic equations ? You can sketch some possible systems to convince yourself that two such graphs can intersect in one point, two points, or no points at all.  Solve the system  We graph these two equations in the standard window and use the intersect feature to locate one of the solutions, as shown in the figure.   You can check that the point is an exact solution to the system by substituting and into each equation of the system. We find the other solution by moving the bug close to the other intersection point and using the intersect feature again. You can verify that the other solution is the point  GC graph showing quadratic system   To solve the system algebraically, we equate the two expressions for .

We can obtain graphs on the calculator by solving each equation for to get Using the window , we obtain the graph shown above. The solutions of the system are the intersection points of the graphs.  For more examples of using elimination, see Section 9.5.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4  For some quadratic systems, we use a combination of elimination of variable sand substitution.  Find the intersection of the circles given by the equations.

  "body": "Logarithmic Functions  Logarithms and Exponents  Before we look at logarithmic functions, let's quickly review exponents and logs. For a particular base, let's say 5, taking a logarithm is the opposite operation for raising to a power. For example, if we raise base 5 to a power of , we get We can say that a logarithm is actually an exponent. Asking for the log base 5 of 25 is asking \"what power of 5, or what exponent on base 5 will give me 25?\"  Write each logarithmic equation as an equivalent exponential equation.       The logarithm asks \"To what power must I raise 3 to get 81?\" The base is 3 and the logarithm (or exponent) is 4, so .  The logarithm asks \"To what power must I raise to get 32?\" The base is and the logarithm (or exponent) is 5, so .   For a more thorough review of logarithms you can refer to Section 7.3.1 .  QuickCheck 1  Now we'll consider functions defined in terms of logarithms, or logarithmic functions logarithmic function . For example, is a logarithmic function. In order to understand logarithmic functions better, we first investigate how they are related to more familiar functions, the exponential functions.   Inverse of a Function  You know that raising to the th power and taking th roots are inverse operations . For example, if we first cube a number and then take the cube root of the result, we return to the original number. Now consider the functions that describe those operations: The graphs of and are related in an interesting way, as shown below.  cube root and cube funcions  If we place a mirror along the line , each graph is the reflection of the other. Or imagine folding the grid along the line , and one graph will match the other exactly. We say that the graphs are \"symmetric about the line .\"  The two functions and are called inverse functions . Look at the tables of values for the two functions.                                         By interchanging the rows in the table for , we get the table for . This makes sense when we recall that each function undoes the effect of the other. In fact, we define the cube root function by  In other words, if we interchange the variables in the cubing function, , to get , we have an equivalent formula for the cube root function, .  Let's look at inverse operations in terms of functions. If we apply a function and then its inverse to an input, we return to that input. Use and , for example, and start by applying the innermost function.  Without the function notation we are simply saying that . But this is an example of the more general rule that if and are inverse functions, then and .  Quickcheck 2   Inverse of an Exponential Function  Because and are inverse functions, we saw that  A similar rule relates the operations of raising a base to a power and taking a base logarithm. You may recall from Chapter 7 that So the function is the inverse function for . Each function undoes the effect of the other. For example, let and . Start with , apply , and then apply to the result. We return to the original number, 3.  And because and are inverse functions, we can write these operations in one expression as (Remember the order of operations: do what's inside of parentheses first, to get .) Because the log and the exponential are inverse functions, this identity holds for any value of and any base . That is We can also apply the two functions in the opposite order, so that (We compute the exponent, , first, and then compute the power .) And in general  For this Example, recall that , the \"common logarithm,\" means . Simplify each expression.      Because and are inverse functions, . You can verify the result on your calculator by first computing and then taking the log of the result.  Again, because and are inverse functions, . You can verify the result on your calculator by first computing and then computing to the result.   and is its inverse function.   What is ?  Evaluate and simplify  Evaluate and simplify    The inverse of a logartihmic function is the exponential function with the same base, so .  First compute . Then .  First compute . Then   To see more examples using function notation, see Section 10.1.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1   Graphs of Logarithmic Functions  What does the graph of a log function look like? We can use exponential functions to help us.  Graph  We can make a table of values for by interchanging the columns in a table for .                                                 We plot the points for each function, connecting them with smooth curves, as shown below. You can see that the two graphs are symmetric about the line .  2 to x and log base 2   For another example of a logarithmic function, see Section 10.1.1 of the Toolkit.  The same technique works for graphing a log function with any base.  Practice 2  and its inverse function :  10 to x and common log   Did you notice that the graphs of the log functions do not have any points with negative -coordinates? This is because an exponential function has no negative (or zero) output values, so a log function has no negative or zero input values.  For example, suppose that . Then . But this is impossible, because cannot be negative. Thus, the log of a negative number (or zero) is undefined. In other words,   In addition, the logarithmic function has the following properties.  Properties of Log Functions  For any base :  The logarithmic function is defined for positive only.  The -intercept x -intercept of its graph is .  The graph has a vertical asymptote at .  The graphs of and are symmetric about the line .   You can also see that while an exponential growth function increases very rapidly for positive input values, its inverse, the logarithmic function, grows extremely slowly.  QuickCheck 3   Using Logarithmic Functions  We can use the LOG key on a calculator to evaluate the function .  Let . Evaluate the following expressions.        , or , is undefined.    Practice 3  Recall that the subscript 10 is often omitted in applications that use common or base 10 logarithms, as illustrated in the following Example.  Evaluate the expression for , and .  Follow the order of operations and calculate    Practice 4  Logarithmic functions are useful for modeling increasing functions increasing function that slow down as the input increases.  Life expectancy at birth is the average number of years a newborn child is expected to live. In 1900, the average life expectancy at birth in the U.S. was 47.3 years, and in 1910 it had risen to 50.0 years. During rest of the twentieth century, life expectancy was modeled by the formula where is the number of years after 1900.  Graph the life expectancy function for the years 1910 to 2000.  The life expectancy in 1950 was 68.2 years. What does the function predict for life expectancy in 1950?  According to the model, how much did life expectancy increase between 1920 and 1930? How much did it increase between 1990 and 2000?    We can make a table of values for and plot points to obtain the graph below, which also shows the actual data points for life expectancy for the decades from 1910 to 2000.                            average life expectancy  We substitute into the function to find The function predicts a life expectancy of 67.4 years in 1950.  Between 1920 and 1930, life expectancy increased from 56.1 to 61.1, or 5 years. Between 1990 and 2000 it increased from 74.6 to 75.9, or 1.3 years.   In the previous Example, we see that although life expectancy has been increasing over time, it has been slowing down or leveling off. In fact, life expectancy in the US actually declined slightly from 78.94 in 2013 to 78.81 in 2018. (What factors may have contributed to this decline?) By 2024 it had rebounded to 79.25. It remains to be seen how well the model predicts life expectancy in the 21st century.

For example, is a log equation.  If there is only one log involved, we can use the conversion equations to write the equation in exponential form. (Recall the conversion equations from Section 7.3.1 .)  Logarithms and Exponents: Conversion Equations conversion equations logarithm conversion equations  If , , and ,   Solve .  We use the conversion equations to write the equation in exponential form. The solution is 36.  Practice 6  If an equation contains more than one log, we must first combine any expressions involving logs into a single logarithm.  Solve .  We use Property (1) of logarithms (see Properties of Logarithms ) to rewrite the left-hand side as a single logarithm: Once the left-hand side is expressed as a single logarithm, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form as Simplifying the right side gives us a quadratic equation to solve. We find or . But let us check both of these values in the original equation.  For we have so is a solution.  But is not a solution of the original equation, because neither nor is defined for . (Remember that we cannot take a logarithm of a negative number or zero.) We say that the apparent solution is extraneous , and the only solution of the original equation is . extraneous solution  to review using the properties of logs, see Section 10.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Extraneous solutions can arise whenever we solve a logarithmic equation, especially if there is more than one apparent solution. Therefore, we should always check that a possible solution does not cause one of the logarithms to be undefined.  Practice 7  QuickCheck 5    Problem Set 10.1  Warm Up  For Problems 1 4, convert the logarithmic equation into exponential form.

On average, the subjects had forgotten 20% of the words. The researchers found that the more lists their volunteers memorized, the larger the fraction of words they were unable to recall.

The water velocity at any point in a stream or river is related to the logarithm of the depth at that point. For the Hoback River near Bondurant, Wyoming, where is the velocity of the water, in feet per second, and is the vertical distance from the stream bed, in feet, at that point. For Pole Creek near Pinedale, Wyoming, Both streams are feet deep at the locations mentioned. (Source: Leopold, Luna, Wolman, and Gordon, 1992)  Complete the table of values for each stream.    Distance from bed (feet)         Velocity, Hoback River, (ft\/sec)         Velocity, Pole Creek (ft\/sec)         If you double the distance from the bed, by how much does the velocity increase in each stream?  Plot both functions on the same graph.  The average velocity of the entire stream can be closely approximated as follows: Measure the velocity at 20% of the total depth of the stream from the surface and at 80% of the total depth, then average these two values. Find the average velocity for the Hoback River and for Pole Creek.   In of this section, we considered a formula for the average life expectancy in the U.S. as a function of years after 1900, According to the formula, in what year was the life expectancy 70 years? 1962  In Practice 5 of this section, we considerd a formula for the average height, in centimeters, of girls between the ages of 2 and 20. According to the formula, at what age should a girl expect to be 152.4 centimeters (5 feet) tall?    "

  "body": "Logarithmic Scales logarithm scale logarithmic scale logarithm  Making a Log Scale  Because grows very slowly as increases from 1, logarithms are useful for modeling phenomena that take on a very wide range of values. For example, biologists study how metabolic functions such as heart rate are related to an animal’s weight, or mass. The table shows the mass in kilograms of several mammals.    Animal  Shrew  Cat  Wolf  Horse  Elephant  Whale   Mass, kg         Imagine trying to scale the -axis to show all of these values. If we set tick marks at intervals of 10,000 kg, as shown below, we can plot the mass of the whale, and maybe the elephant, but the dots for the smaller animals will be indistinguishable. (On this graph, the first dot would have to represent the shrew, cat, wolf and horse!)  number line with masses of mammals  On the other hand, we can plot the mass of the cat if we set tick marks at intervals of 1 kg, but the axis will have to be extremely long to include even the wolf. We cannot show the masses of all these animals on the same scale.  number line with masses of mammals  To get around this problem, we'll compute the the log of each mass, and use the logs on a new scale. The table below shows the base 10 log of each animal's mass, rounded to 2 decimal places.    Animal  Shrew  Cat  Wolf  Horse  Elephant  Whale   Mass, kg         Log (mass)         The logs of the masses range from to . We can easily plot these values on a single scale, as shown below.  mammal masses plotted on log scale  We'd need to keep in mind that we are plotting the logs of the animals' masses, and not the actual masses. However, remember that a logarithm is really an exponent! For example, the mass of the horse is 300 kg, and So instead of plotting the logs from the table, we will plot powers of 10 that give the actual masses of the animals, like this:  mammal masses plotted on log scale  Compare this new scale to the previous one. It looks almost the same, except that the number line is labeled with powers of 10. Even though we computed the log of each mass, we still plotted the actual mass of each animal, in its form as a power of 10. It is the scale on the number line that has changed.  A scale labeled with powers of 10 is called a logarithmic scale logarithmic scale , or log scale. The powers of 10 on a log scale are evenly spaced, so that the actual values at the tick marks look like this.  logscale with integer exponents  We can see right away that the increments between tick marks on a log scale are not equal, as they are on a usual linear scale. The increments get larger as we move from left to right on the scale. However, when we are plotting powers of 10 we use the exponents to place the data points on the scale. For example, you can check that the mass of the horse, at kg, is plotted about half-way between and on the log scale, because 2.48 is about half-way between 2 and 3. Similarly, the mass of the cat, at kg, is plotted between and on the log scale.  Plot the values on a log scale.              We first compute the base 10 logarithm of each number.                     Then we plot each number as a power of 10, estimating its position between powers with integer exponents. For example, we plot the first value, , closer to than to . The finished plot is shown below.  points plotted on log scale   For more examples plotting log scales, see Section 10.2.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1  points on logscale   QuickCheck 1   Labeling a Log Scale  Log scales allow us to plot a wide range of values, but there is a trade-off. Equal increments on a log scale do not correspond to equal differences in value, as they do on a linear scale. You can see this more clearly if we label the tick marks with their integer values, as well as powers of 10. The difference between and is , but the difference between and is .  logscale with integer exponents  As we move from left to right on this scale, we multiply the value at the previous tick mark by 10. Moving up by equal increments on a log scale does not add equal amounts to the values plotted; it multiplies the values by equal factors . In the next Example, observe how the integers are plotted on a log scale: they are not evenly spaced.  Plot the integer values 2 through 9 and 20 through 90 on a log scale.  We compute the logarithm of each integer value.                                              We plot the integers on a log scale, as shown below.   log scale showing integer points    Notice that the spacing between the integers 2 through 9 is the same as the spacing between the integers 20 through 90.   On the log scale in , notice how the integer values are spaced: They get closer together as they approach the next power of . If we would like to label a log scale with integers, we get a very different looking scale, one in which the tick marks are not evenly spaced.  Here is a log scale labeled not with powers of , but with integer values, like this:   log scale showing some integers at tick marks    Some applications use log-log graph paper log-log graph paper , which scales both axes with logarithmic scales. On the graph in the next Checkpoint, the tick marks between powers of 10 show integer values, as on the scale above.  Practice 2  mouse-to-elephant curve on log-log graph   QuickCheck 2  You may have already encountered log scales in some everyday applications. In the examples that follow, don't worry if you aren't familiar with the science surrounding the application; we will mainly be concerned with the mathematics of using the scale.   Acidity and the pH Scale  You have probably heard that the pH value of most shampoo is between 7 and 9. The pH scale pH scale acid (pH) scale is a log scale used to measure the acidity of a substance or a chemical compound. Acidity depends on the concentration of hydrogen ions in the substance, denoted by , which can take on a wide range of values, from to .  To simplify the numbers we have to work with, we define the pH value by By taking the log of (and changing its sign), we are looking at just its exponent, so that values for pH fall between 0 and 14. A pH value of 7 indicates a neutral solution, and the lower the pH value, the more acidic the substance.  Some common substances and their pH values are shown in the table.     Substance  pH    Battery acid     Lemon juice     Vinegar     Milk     Baking soda     Milk of magnesia     Lye     Notice that the pH values are a log scale, so that a decrease of 1 on the pH scale corresponds to an increase in by a factor of 10. Thus, lemon juice is 10 times more acidic than vinegar, and battery acid is 100 times more acidic than vinegar.   Calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of .  The water in a swimming pool should be maintained at a pH of 7.5. What is the hydrogen ion concentration of the water?    We use a calculator to evaluate the pH formula with .  We solve the equation for . First, we write Then we convert the equation to exponential form to get The hydrogen ion concentration of the water is .   Practice 3   Decibels  The decibel scale decibel scale , used to measure the loudness of a sound, is another example of a logarithmic scale. The loudness of a sound depends on the intensity of its sound waves, which is measured in watts per square meter. The decibel value, , is given by Once again, taking the log of simplifies the numbers involved by considering just their exponents. (And dividing by brings the values into a convenient range.)  The table below shows the intensity of some common sounds.    Sound  Intensity (watts\/m )  Decibels   Whisper     Background music     Loud conversation     Heavy traffic     Jet airplane     Thunder     Consider the ratio of the intensity of thunder to that of a whisper: Thunder is , or one billion times more intense than a whisper. It would be impossible to show such a wide range of values on a graph. When we use a log scale, however, there is a difference of only 90 decibels between a whisper and thunder.   Normal breathing generates about watts per square meter of intensity at a distance of 3 feet. Find the number of decibels for a breath 3 feet away.  Normal conversation registers at about 40 decibels. How many times more intense than breathing is normal conversation?   We evaluate the decibel formula with to find The sound of breathing registers at 10 decibels.  From part (a), we know that the sound intensity of breathing is watts per square meter. We'll calculate the intensity of conversation from its decibel value. Finally, we compute the ratio of intensities: Normal conversation is 1000 times more intense than breathing.   Practice 4  Both the decibel model and the Richter scale in the next example use expressions of the form . Be careful to follow the order of operations when using these models. We must compute the quotient before taking a logarithm. In particular, keep in mind that can be simplified to .   The Richter Scale Richter scale (or magnitude)  One method for measuring the magnitude of an earthquake compares the amplitude of its seismographic trace with the amplitude of the smallest detectable earthquake. The log of their ratio is the Richter Richter scale (or magnitude) magnitude, . Thus,   The Northridge earthquake of January 1994 registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. What would be the magnitude of an earthquake 100 times as powerful as the Northridge quake?  How many times more powerful than the Northridge quake was the San Francisco earthquake of 1989, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale?    The amplitude of the Northridge quake is given by and by rewriting in exponential form we find An earthquake 100 times as powerful would have amplitude Thus, the magnitude of the more powerful quake is  In part (a) we used the Richter formula to find that the amplitude of the Northridge quake was Similarly, the amplitude of the San Francisco quake was So the ratio of their amplitudes is The San Francisco earthquake was , or approximately 1.58 times as powerful as the Northridge quake.   Practice 5   Comparing Quantities on a Log Scale  An earthquake 100, or , times as strong is only two units greater in magnitude on the Richter scale. In general, a difference of units on the Richter scale (or any logarithmic scale) corresponds to a factor of units in the intensity of the quake.  For more about comparing quantities, see Section 10.2.2 of the Toolkit.  On a log scale, the weights of two animals differ by 1.6 units. What is the ratio of their actual weights?

There is another base for logarithms and exponential functions that is used in scientific applications. This base is an irrational number called , where  To review exponential functions, see Section 7.2 of the textbook.  The number is essential for many advanced topics, and it is often called the natural base . natural base It may seem strange to use an irrational number as the base for exponential functions, but just as the irrational number arises naturally in geometry, so does arise in calculus and its applications. At the end of this section we'll look at a specific case of how base occurs, and how its use is connected to the ideas and techniques of calculus.  The Natural Exponential Function  The natural exponential function natural exponential function exponential function exponential function natural function natural exponential e is the function Values for can be obtained with a calculator using the key ( 2nd  LN on most calculators). For example, you can evaluate by pressing  2nd  LN   to confirm the value of given above. (We'll explain why we use the 2nd  LN key a little later.)  Try a few more calculations to become familiar with base .  Practice 1  What about the graph of this new exponential function? Because is a number between 2 and 3, the graph of lies between the graphs of and . Compare the table of values and the graphs of the three functions below.

The average or mean height for men is 70 inches, and the formula for the graph is Evaluate the function for and for .  The probability that a given man has a height between two values is the area under the curve between those values.  To evaluate the function we follow the order of operations.

How does the coefficient of make each graph different from the graph of ?     horizontal scaling of exponential   The graph of is shown in red. For positive , the coefficient makes the graph of grow more slowly than , because is smaller than . So for positive the graph of lies below the graph of .  Because , the graph of is decreasing, and in fact it is the reflection of the graph of about the -axis.    The Natural Logarithmic Function  Recall that each exponential function with base has an inverse function, the logarithmic function with the same base. For example, the function is the inverse of the function . It gives the exponent needed on 2 to give , so that, for instance, , because .  To review logarithmic functions, see Section 7.3 of the textbook.  The base e logarithm of a number , or , is called the natural logarithm natural logarithm of and is denoted by . (Why ln and not nl ? The natural logarithm is denoted by ln because it stands for logarithmus naturalis, which is the Latin for natural logarithm. ) Here is its official definition.  The Natural Logarithm natural logarithm  The natural logarithm is the logarithm base .   The natural logarithm of is the exponent to which must be raised to produce . For example, the natural logarithm of , or , is the solution of the equation You can verify on your calculator that  As is the case with exponential and log functions with other bases, the natural log function natural log function , , and the natural exponential function, , undo each other, so they are inverse functions. (This is why many calculators use 2nd  LN to indicate .)  Practice 3  As usual, we can gain a better understanding of a new function by looking at its graph.  Graph and on the same grid.  Earlier we made a table of values to graph the fuction , and we can make a table of values for by interchanging the columns in that table. Plotting the points gives us the graph below.                              graphs of ln and natural exponential  You can see that the graph of is the reflection of the graph of about the line . In particular, notice that while the graph of has no points with negative -values, the graph of has no points with negative -values.  From the graph of you can make the following observations.   The natural log function has only positive numbers as input values.  The natural logs of negative numbers and zero are undefined.  The natural log of a number greater than 1 is positive, while the logs of numbers between 0 and 1 are negative.   To see some interesting properties of the graphs of and , see Section 10.3.1 of the Toolkit.   Properties of the Natural Logarithm  In general, natural logs obey the same conversion equations that work for logs to other bases. In fact, all the techniques you have already learned for working with exponential and log functions still work for base .  Conversion Equations for Natural Logs   QuickCheck 2  In particular,  The three properties of logarithms you learned in Section 7.4 also apply to base logarithms.  Properties of Natural Logarithms  If , then     If , is undefined.  Because the functions and are inverse functions, the following properties are also true.  The Natural Log and   Simplify each expression.      The natural log is the log base , and hence the inverse of . Therefore,  First, we simplify the exponent using the third property of logs to get Then .   Practice 4   Solving Equations  We use the natural logarithm to solve exponential equations with base . The techniques we've learned for solving other exponential equations also apply to equations with base .  exponential equation exponential equation solving with logarithms  To review solving exponential equations, see Section 7.4.3 of the textbook.  Solve each equation for .      We convert the equation to logarithmic form and evaluate using a calculator.  We convert the equation to exponential form and evaluate.   Practice 5  QuickCheck 3  To solve more complicated exponential equations, we isolate the power on one side of the equation before converting to logarithmic form. exponential equation solving  Solve  First, we isolate the power. Then we convert the equation to logarithmic form. Rounded to four decimal places, .  When solving the equation in the Example above, we can think of taking the natural logarithm of both sides. This gives us because for any number . We then proceed with the solution as before.  Practice 6   The logistic function has its upper bound at . Find the value of for which .  We must solve the equation for . To begin, we multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator, , to get Then we isolate the power, , as follows: Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to get and recall that to simplify the left side. Finally, we divide both sides by to solve for .  Practice 7   Exponential Growth and Decay  Recall that functions of the form describe exponential growth when and exponential decay when .  To review exponential growth, see Section 7.1.2 of the textbook.  Exponential growth and decay can also be modeled by functions of the form where we have substituted for the growth factor , so that We can find the value of by solving the equation for , to get . exponential decay exponential growth  For instance, consider a colony of bacteria that grows according to the formula We can express this function in the form if we set Thus, the growth law for the colony of bacteria can be written   By graphing both functions on your calculator, you can verify that are just two ways of writing the same function.  P(t) equals 100 3 to the t   Sometimes exponential growth is given as a percentage, so for example we might say prices rose by 5% annually. In this case the growth factor is , where is the percentage rate in decimal form. For a percent decrease, .  To review percent increase, see Section 7.1.5 of the textbook.  From 1990 to 2000, the population of Clark County, Nevada, grew by per year.    What was the growth factor for the population of Clark County from 1990 to 2000? If the population of Clark County was 768,000 in 1990, write a formula for the population years later.  Write a growth formula for Clark County using base .    The growth factor was . The population years later was  We use the formula , where . Solving for , we find so .   To see more examples using the natural exponential function, see Section 10.3.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 8  Now, what about exponential decay, where the the decay fator is a number less than 1? If is negative, then is a number less than 1. For example, if , Thus, for negative values of , the function describes exponential decay.   Exponential Growth and Decay exponential growth exponential decay  The function describes exponential growth if , and exponential decay if .   QuickCheck 4  Express the decay law in the form .  For this decay law, and . We would like to find a value for so that , that is, we must solve the equation Replacing with , we find that the decay law is  Practice 9  Graph for part (b)  decay    Continuous Compounding  In Section 7.5.4 we looked at a formula for savings accounts on which the interest is compounded times per year, and we saw that the amount on such an account increased when increased. But there is a limit or upper bound to the amount, no matter how large the value of . At this upper bound we say that the interest is compounded continuously compounded continuously , and the amount is given by the function where is the principal invested and is the interest rate.  For an explanation of this formula, see Investigation 10.3.7 below.  Suppose you invest $500 in an account that pays 8% interest compounded continuously. You leave the money in the account without making any additional deposits or withdrawals.  Write a formula that gives the value of your account after years.  Make a table of values showing for the first 5 years.  Graph the function .  How much will the account be worth after 10 years?  How long will it be before the account is worth $1000?    We substitute 500 for , and 0.08 for to find  We evaluate the formula for to obtain a table.                          graph of continuous compounded interest  The graph of is shown above.  We evaluate for . The account will be worth $1112.77 after 10 years.  We substitute 1000 for and solve the equation. The account will be worth $1000 after approximately 8.7 years.   Practice 10  In the next Investigation we'll see how the formula for interest compounded continuously, , arises when , the number of compounding periods, increases.  Interest Compounded Continuously  We learned in Section 7.5.4 that the amount, (principal plus interest), accumulated in an account with interest compounded times annually is where is the principal invested, is the interest rate, and is the time period, in years.   Suppose you keep in an account that pays 8% interest. How much is the amount after 1 year if the interest is compounded twice a year? Four times a year?  What happens to as we increase , the number of compounding periods per year? Fill in the table showing the amount in the account for different values of .        (annually)    (semiannually)    (quarterly)    (bimonthly)    (monthly)    (daily)          grid  Plot the values in the table from to , and connect them with a smooth curve. Describe the curve: What is happening to the value of ?  In part (2), as you increased the value of , the other parameters in the formula stayed the same. In other words, is a function of , given by . Use your calculator to graph A on successively larger intervals:      Use the Trace feature or the Table feature to evaluate for very large values of . Rounded to the nearest penny, what is the largest value of that you can find?  As increases, the values of approach a limiting value. Although continues to increase, it does so by smaller and smaller increments and will never exceed $1083.29. When the number of compounding periods increases without bound, we call the limiting result continuous compounding continuous compounding .  Is there an easier way to compute under continues compounding? Yes! Compute on your calculator. (Press 2nd  LN to enter .) Compare the value to your answer in part (5) for the limiting value.  Repeat your calculations for two other interest rates, 15% and (an extremely unrealistic) 100%, again for an investment of $1000 for 1 year. In each case, compare the limiting value of , and compare to the value of .                                                                 In part (8b), you have computed an approximation for . What is the value of , rounded to 5 decimal places?  Complete the table of values. What does appear to approach as increases?                 In the Investigation, we saw that the number arises as the limiting value of the expression as increases without bound. The limiting process is one of the fundamental methods of calculus, and helps us understand and analyze other continuous phenomena, such as rates of growth.

We can make a table of values for the inverse function by interchanging the columns of a table for .  If we apply the inverse function to the output of , we return to the original input value.  The graphs of and its inverse function are symmetric about the line .  We define the logarithmic function, , which takes the log base of its input values. The log function is the inverse of the exponential function .  Because and are inverse functions for ,   A logarithmic equation is one where the variable appears inside of a logarithm. We can solve logarithmic equations by converting to exponential form.  Steps for Solving Logarithmic Equations   Use the properties of logarithms to combine all logs into one log.  Isolate the log on one side of the equation.  Convert the equation to exponential form.  Solve for the variable.  Check for extraneous solutions.  The natural base is an irrational number called , where  The natural exponential function is the function . The natural log function is the function .  Conversion Formulas for the Natural Base   Properties of Natural Logarithms  If , then    also   We use the natural logarithm to solve exponential equations with base .  Exponential Growth and Decay  The function describes exponential growth if , and exponential decay if .  Continuous compounding : The amount accumulated in an account after years at interest rate compounded continuously is given by where is the principal invested.  A log scale is useful for plotting values that vary greatly in magnitude. We plot the log of the variable, instead of the variable itself.  A log scale is a multiplicative scale : Each increment of equal length on the scale indicates that the value is multiplied by an equal amount.  The pH value of a substance is defined by the formula where denotes the concentration of hydrogen ions in the substance.  The loudness of a sound is measured in decibels, , by where is the intensity of its sound waves (in watts per square meter).  The Richter magnitude, , of an earthquake is given by where is the amplitude of its seismographic trace and is the amplitude of the smallest detectable earthquake.  A difference of units on a logarithmic scale corresponds to a factor of units in the value of the variable.

Solve  First, we remove parentheses by applying the distributive law. Then we can combine like terms on each side of the equation.  Note that the minus sign in front of the parentheses on the right side of the equation applies to both terms inside the parentheses.   Solve the inequality  We begin by the same way we solve an equation. For this example, we start by removing the parentheses.

Linear Systems  Write equations in two variables  Applied problems that involve more than one unknown are often easier to model and solve with a system of equations.  Write equations about the number of tables and the number of chairs:  There are four chairs for each table.  Chairs cost $125 each; a table costs $350. Darryl spent $10,200 on tables and chairs.    Let be the number of tables and the number of chairs.  The number of chairs is 4 times the number of tables: .    Write equations about the dimensions of a rectangle:  The perimeter of the rectangle is 42 meters.  The length is 3 meters more than twice the width.

A hamburger and a chocolate shake together contain 1020 calories.  Two shakes and three hamburgers contain 2710 calories.      Write equations about the vertex angle and the base angles of an isosceles triangle.  The vertex angle is less than each base angle.  The sum of the angles in a triangle is .       Identify the solution of a system  Recall that a solution to a system makes each equation in the system true.  Decide whether is a solution of the system   A solution must satisfy both equations. We substitute and into the equations. Yes, is a solution  Find the solution of the system graphed below.  Linear system   The solution must lie on both graphs, so it is the intersection point, . The coordinates of point are , so the solution of the system is .  Decide whether is a solution of the system No  Find the solution of the system graphed below.  Linear system   Use the formula for profit,  Profit  To find the profit earned by a company we subtract the costs from the revenue.  \"Revenue\" is the amount of money a company takes in from selling its product. A negative profit is the same as a loss.  The owner of a sandwich shop spent $800 last week for labor and supplies. She received $1150 in revenue. What was her profit?  We evaluate the formula with and to find The owner's profit was $350.  EcoGreen made $1848 profit on low-flow shower heads last year, and spent $3426 in costs. What was their revenue from shower heads?  We usse the profit formula and solve the equation to find that . Their revenue was $5094.   The Earth Alliance made $6000 in revenue from selling tickets to Earth Day, an educational event for children. Write an expression for their profit in terms of their costs.  What was their profit if their costs were $2500?    $3500   Last week Moe's Auto Shop took in $5400 in revenue, but experienced a loss of $800. What were Moe's costs last week? $6200    Algebraic Solution of Systems  Some familiar formulas are useful in writing equations to solve a problem.  Use the interest formula,  You have $5000 to invest for one year. You want to put part of the money into bonds that pay 7% interest, and the rest of the money into stocks that involve some risk but will pay 12% if successful. Now suppose you decide to invest dollars in stocks and dollars in bonds.  Use the interest formula, , to write expressions for the interest earned on the bonds and on the stocks.  Write an equation about the amount invested.  Write an equation to say that the total interest earned was $400.    Stocks: Bonds:     Mort invested money in two accounts, a savings plan that pays 8% interest and a mutual fund that pays 7% interest. He put twice as much money in the savings plan as in the mutual fund. At the end of the year Mort's total interest income was $345. How much did he invest in each account?  Use the interest formula to write expressions for the interest Mort earned on the savings plan and the interest he earned on the mutual fund.  Write an equation about the amount Mort invested.  Write an equation about the interest Mort earned.        Use the percent formula,  A pharmacist has on hand a solution of a certain medication at 40% strength, but she needs 48 ounces of the medication at 75% strength for a prescription. She decides to add a pure form of the medication to the 40% solution. How much of the each strength solution should she add to make a mixture of 75% strength?  Choose variables for the unknown quantities.  Write an equation about the amount of 75% solution.  Use the percent formula, , to calculate the amount of the medication in the original solution.  Use the percent formula to calculate the amount of the medication in the mixture.  Write an equation about the amount of medication.    Let stand for tthe amount of 40% solution and for the pure solution.        A pet store owner wants to mix a 12% saltwater solution and a 30% saltwater solution to obtain 90 liters of a 24% solution. He uses quarts of the 12% solution and quarts of the 30% solution.  Write an equation about the total amount of saltwater.  Use the percent formula to write expressions about the amount of salt in each original solution.  How many liters of salt are in the mixture?  Write an equation about the amount of salt.         Use the distance formula,  A river steamer requires 3 hours to travel 24 miles upstream and 2 hours for the return trip downstream. Let be the speed of the current and the speed of the steamer in still water.  Write an equation about the upstream trip.  Write an equation about the downstream trip.    The speed of the steamer aginst the current is , so  The speed of the steamer with the current is , so   A yacht leaves San Diego and heads south, traveling at 25 miles per hour. Six hours later a Coast Guard cutter leaves San Diego traveling at 40 miles per hour and pursues the yacht. Let be the time it takes the cutter to catch the yacht, and the distance it traveled.  Write an equation about the yacht's journey.  Write an equation about the cutter's journey.        Gaussian Reduction  Write an equation in standard form  Before we can use Gaussian reduction, we must write each equation in standard form.  Write the equation in standard form.

Write a 3x3 linear system  Write a 3x3 linear system for the following problem:  Ace, Inc. produces three types of wooden rackets: tennis rackets, Ping-Pong paddles, and squash rackets. After the pieces are cut, each racket requires three phases of production: gluing, sanding and finishing. A tennis racket takes 3 hours to glue, 2 hours to sand, and 3 hours to finish. A Ping-Pong paddle takes 1 hour to glue, 1 hour to sand, and 1 hour to finish. A squash racket takes 2 hours to glue, 2 hours to sand, and 2.5 hours to finish. Ace has available 95 labor-hours for gluing, 75 labor-hours for sanding, and 100 labor-hours for finishing per day. How many of each racket should it make in order to use all the available time?  Let , , and stand for the number of tennis rackets, Ping-Pong paddles, and squash rackets, respectively. Write three equations about the number of hours needed for each phase:  Write a 3x3 linear system for the following problem:  A box contains $6.25 in nickels, dimes, and quarters. There are 85 coins in all, with 3 times as many nickels as dimes. How many coins of each kind are there? Let , , and stand for the number of nickels, dimes, and quarters, respectively.     Linear Inequalities in Two Variables  Solve a linear inequality  Before we solve inequalities in two variables, let's review solving linear inequalities in one variable.

First, multiply the binomial factors together. Then use the distributive law to multiply the result by the monomial factor, .   Expand the product .   Expand the product .  Expand the product .  Expand the product .   Factor quadratic trinomials  To factor the trinomial , we look for two numbers and whose product is the constant term and whose sum is the coefficient of the middle term.  Sign Patterns for Quadratic Trinomials  Assume that and are positive integers. Then   If all the coefficients of the trinomial are positive, then both and are positive.   If the middle term of the trinomial is negative and the other two terms are positive, then and are both negative.   If the constant term of the trinomial is negative, then and have opposite signs.   Factor as a product of two binomials,  The constant term is , so we look for two numbers and whose product is . There are three possibilities: Because the middle term is , we must have . We check each possibility and find that and . Thus,   Factor .  For this example we must find two numbers and for which and . These two conditions tell us that and must both be negative. We start by listing all the ways to factor with negative factors: We check for each possibility to see which one gives the correct middle term. Because , the factorization is  Factor .  This time the product must be negative, so and must have opposite signs, one positive and one negative. There are only two ways to factor , either times or times . We just \"guess\" that the second factor is negative, and check for each possibility: The middle term we want is , not , so we change the signs of and : we use and . The correct factorization is  Factor  Factor  Factor  Factor  Factor  Factor   Write algebraic expressions  Ralph and Wanda together weigh 320 pounds.

They meet at a cafe between their houses. If Delbert drove miles, how far did Francine drive?  We subtract Delbert's distance from the total; the remainder is Francine's distance: miles  Three eggs and two slices of buttered toast contain 526 calories. If one egg contains calories, how many calories are in a slice of buttered toast?  We subtract the calories in three eggs from the total; the remainder is the number of calories in two slices of toast, so one slice has half that many calories:  The perimeter of a large rectangular playground is 124 yards. If its width is yards, what is its length?

Evaluate absolute values  The definition of how to take an absolute value may look complicated, but it just says two things:  If the number is positive, leave it alone.  If the number is negative, put another negative in front, which will make the number positive.   Simplify each expression.       The absolute value of any number is positive (or zero). We can think of the absolute value of a number as its distnce from on a number line.  is 3 units from 0, so .  is the opposite of , so .  The opposite of is , so .  is the opposite of , so .

Find the LCD for the fractions.        Find the LCD for the fractions.         Build fractions  Before we can add unlike fractions, we must build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as denominator.  Write an equivalent fraction with the new denominator:  We first find the building factor for the fraction: what must we mulitply the old denominator by to get the new denominator? We factor the new denominator to see what factors are missing.  The new denominator is , so we need to multiply the old denominator by . This is the building factor. We multiply top and bottom of the old fraction by the building factor:   Write an equivalent fraction with the new denominator:  The new denominator factors as , so the building factor is .
