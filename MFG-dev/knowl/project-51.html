</h6>
<p>Water slowly contracts as it cools, causing it to become denser, until just before freezing, when the density decreases slightly. The salinity of water affects its freezing point and also the temperature at which it reaches its maximum density: The higher the salinity, the lower the temperature at which the maximum density occurs. Pure water is densest at \(4\degree\)C and freezes at \(0\degree\)C. Water that is \(15\%\) saline is densest at \(0.8\degree\)C and freezes at \(-0.8\degree\)C. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write an equation for the water's temperature of maximum density in terms of its salinity in percent.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an equation for the water's freezing point in terms of its salinity in percent.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the system of equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the system to find the salinity of water that freezes when it is densest. What is the freezing point?</p></li>
