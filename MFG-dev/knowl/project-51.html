<div class="para">Water slowly contracts as it cools, causing it to become denser, until just before freezing, when the density decreases slightly. The salinity of water affects its freezing point and also the temperature at which it reaches its maximum density: The higher the salinity, the lower the temperature at which the maximum density occurs. Pure water is densest at <span class="process-math">\(4\degree\)</span>C and freezes at <span class="process-math">\(0\degree\)</span>C. Water that is <span class="process-math">\(15\%\)</span> saline is densest at <span class="process-math">\(0.8\degree\)</span>C and freezes at <span class="process-math">\(-0.8\degree\)</span>C.</div>
