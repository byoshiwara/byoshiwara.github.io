<p>The Isle Royale moose eats deciduous leaves, which provide \(3.01\) kilocalories of energy per gram, and aquatic plants, which provide \(3.82\) kilocalories per gram. The moose needs at least \(10,946\) kilocalories of food per day, and its daily sodium requirement must be met by consuming at least \(453\) grams of aquatic plants. It takes the moose \(0.05\) minute to eat one gram of aquatic plants and \(0.06\) minute to eat each gram of leaves. To maintain its thermal balance, the moose cannot spend more than \(150\) minutes each day standing in water and eating aquatics plants, or more than \(256\) minutes eating leaves. Each gram of aquatic plants becomes \(20\) wet grams in the moose's stomach, and each gram of leaves becomes \(4\) wet grams, and the stomach can hold no more than \(32,900\) wet grams of food daily.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write a system of inequalities for the number of grams of aquatic plants and of leaves the moose can eat.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Give two possible combinations of aquatic plants and leaves that satisfy the mooseâ€™s feeding requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Can the moose survive by eating only aquatic plants?</p></li>
</ol>
