<p>Have you ever wondered why time seems to pass more quickly as we grow older? One theory suggests that the human mind judges the length of a long period of time by comparing it with its current age. For example, a year is <span class="process-math">\(20\%\)</span> of a <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span>-year-old's lifetime, but only <span class="process-math">\(5\%\)</span> of a <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span>-year-old's, so a year feels longer to a <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span>-year-old. Thus, psychological time follows a log scale, like the one shown in the figure.</p>
