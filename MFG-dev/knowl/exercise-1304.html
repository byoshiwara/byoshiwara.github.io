<p>In the 1970s, McNeill Alexander proposed a relationship between an animal's running speed, \(v\text{,}\) its hip height, \(h\text{,}\) and its stride length, \(s\text{.}\) If stride and hip height are measured in meters, the running speed is given in meters per second by</p>
\begin{equation*}
v = f (h, s) = 0.78s^{1.67}h^{-1.17}
\end{equation*}
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>What is the speed of a racehorse whose hip height is \(1.6\) meters and stride length is \(7\) meters?</p></li>
<li><p>A cheetah can run at \(33\) meters per second. If its hip height is \(0.8\) meters, what is its stride length?</p></li>
<li><p>A pronghorn antelope has the same stride length as a cheetah and its hip height is \(12\%\) greater than the cheetah's. How does its running speed compare to a cheetah's?</p></li>
