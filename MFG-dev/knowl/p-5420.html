<p>While bicycling from home to school, Greg gets a flat tire. He repairs the tire in just a few minutes but decides to backtrack a few miles to a service station, where he cleans up. Finally, he bicycles the rest of the way to school. Graph the distance between Greg and his home as a function of time, from the moment he leaves home until he arrives at school.</p>
