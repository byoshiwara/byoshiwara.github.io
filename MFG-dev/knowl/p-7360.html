<p>If you walk in the normal way, your maximum speed, <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> in meters per second, is limited by the length of your legs, <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> according to the formula</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
v=\sqrt{gr}

<p class="continuation">where the constant <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is approximately <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> meters per second squared. (Source: Alexander, 1992)</p>

<li><p>A typical adult man has legs about <span class="process-math">\(0.9\)</span> meter long. How fast can he walk?</p></li>

<li><p>Race-walkers can walk as fast as <span class="process-math">\(4.4\)</span> meters per second by rotating their hips so that the effective length of their legs is increased. What is that effective length?</p></li>
