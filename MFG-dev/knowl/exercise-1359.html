<div class="para">A bicycle ergometer is used to measure the amount of power generated by a cyclist. The scatterplot shows how long an athlete was able to sustain various levels of power output. The curve is the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = 500x^{-0.29}\text{,}\)</span> which approximately models the data.
