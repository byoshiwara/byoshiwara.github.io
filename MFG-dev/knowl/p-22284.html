<li>A sequence in which each term can be obtained from the previous term by adding a fixed amount is called an <dfn class="terminology">arithmetic sequence</dfn>.</li>
<li>The fixed amount between two successive terms of an arithmetic sequence is called the <dfn class="terminology">common difference</dfn>.</li>
<li>An arithmetic sequence defines a linear function of \(n\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of an arithmetic sequence is \(a_n = a + (n-1)d\text{.}\)</li>
<li>A sequence in which each term can be obtained from the previous term by multiplying by a fixed amount is called a <dfn class="terminology">geometric sequence</dfn>.</li>
<li>The ratio of two successive terms of a geometridc sequence is called the <dfn class="terminology">common ratio</dfn>.</li>
<li>A geometric sequence defines an exponential function of \(n\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of a geometric sequence is \(a_n = ar^{n-1}\text{.}\)</li>
