<p>A biologist isolates two strains of a particular virus and monitors the growth of each, starting with samples of <span class="process-math">\(0.01\)</span> gram. Strain A increases by <span class="process-math">\(10\%\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> hours and strain B increases by <span class="process-math">\(12\%\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> hours.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>How much did the sample of strain A weigh after <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> hours? What was its hourly growth factor?</p></li>
<li><p>How much did the sample of strain B weigh after <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> hours? What was its hourly growth factor?</p></li>
<li><p>Which strain of virus grows more rapidly?</p></li>
