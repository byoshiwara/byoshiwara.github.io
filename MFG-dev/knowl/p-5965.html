<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>The number of hours of daylight in Salt Lake City varies from a minimum of <span class="process-math">\(9.6\)</span> hours on the winter solstice to a maximum of <span class="process-math">\(14.4\)</span> hours on the summer solstice.</p></li>
<li><p>A weight is <span class="process-math">\(6.5\)</span> feet above the floor, suspended from the ceiling by a spring. The weight is pulled down to <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> feet above the floor and released, rising past <span class="process-math">\(6.5\)</span> feet in <span class="process-math">\(0.5\)</span> second before attaining its maximum height of <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> feet. Neglecting the effects of friction, the height of the weight will continue to oscillate between its minimum and maximum height.</p></li>
<li><p>The voltage used in U.S. electrical current changes from <span class="process-math">\(155\)</span> V to <span class="process-math">\(-155\)</span> V and back <span class="process-math">\(60\)</span> times each second.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the moon is spherical, what we can see from Earth looks like a (sometimes only partly visible) disk. The percentage of the moon's disk that is visible varies between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> (at new moon) to <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> (at full moon).</p></li>
