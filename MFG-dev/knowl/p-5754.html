<p>Because the scale shows the weight as \(6.0\) grams, we know that the true weight of the sample must be between \(5.95\) grams and \(6.05\) grams: If the weight were less than \(5.95\) grams, the scale would round down to \(5.9\) grams, and if the weight were more than \(6.05\) grams, the scale would round up to \(6.1\) grams. We should report the mass of the sample as \(6 \pm 0.05\) grams, which tells the reader that the error in the measurement is no more than \(0.05\) grams.</p>
