<div class="para">Have you ever wondered why time seems to pass more quickly as we grow older? One theory suggests that the human mind judges the length of a long period of time by comparing it with its current age. For example, a year is <span class="process-math">\(20\%\)</span> of a <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span>-year-old’s lifetime, but only <span class="process-math">\(5\%\)</span> of a <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span>-year-old’s, so a year feels longer to a <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span>-year-old. Thus, psychological time follows a log scale, like the one shown in the figure.</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"><div class="sbspanel top" style="width:100%;"><img src="external/images/fig-5-4-14.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="ages on log scale"></div></div></div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Label the tick marks with their base <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> logarithms, rounded to <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> decimal places. What do you notice about the values?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">By computing their logs, locate <span class="process-math">\(18\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(22\)</span> on the scale</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Four years of college seems like a long time to an <span class="process-math">\(18\)</span>-year-old. What length of time feels the same to a <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span>-year-old?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">How long will the rest of your life feel? Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be your current age, and let <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> be the age to which you think you will live. Compute the difference of their logs. Now move backward on the log scale an equal distance from your current age. What is the age at that spot? Call that age <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> The rest of your life will feel the same as your life from age <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> until now.</div></li>
