<p>Two student pilots leave the airport at the same time. They both fly at an airspeed of \(180\) miles per hour, but one flies with the wind and the other flies against the wind. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>Express the time it takes the first pilot to travel \(500\) miles as a function of the windspeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Express the time it takes the second pilot to travel \(400\) miles as a function of the windspeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the two functions in the same window, and find the coordinates of the intersection point. Interpret those coordinates in the context of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Both pilots check in with their instructors at the same time, and the first pilot has traveled \(500\) miles while the second pilot has gone \(400\) miles. Write an equation to describe this situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve your equation to find the speed of the wind.</p></li>
