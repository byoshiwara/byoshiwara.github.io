<p>Two student pilots leave the airport at the same time. They both fly at an airspeed of <span class="process-math">\(180\)</span> miles per hour, but one flies with the wind and the other flies against the wind.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Express the time it takes the first pilot to travel <span class="process-math">\(500\)</span> miles as a function of the windspeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Express the time it takes the second pilot to travel <span class="process-math">\(400\)</span> miles as a function of the windspeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the two functions in the same window, and find the coordinates of the intersection point. Interpret those coordinates in the context of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Both pilots check in with their instructors at the same time, and the first pilot has traveled <span class="process-math">\(500\)</span> miles while the second pilot has gone <span class="process-math">\(400\)</span> miles. Write an equation to describe this situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve your equation to find the speed of the wind.</p></li>
