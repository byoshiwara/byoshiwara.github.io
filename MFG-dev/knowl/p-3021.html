<p>Six students are trying to identify an unknown chemical compound by heating the substance and measuring the density of the gas that evaporates. (Density <span class="process-math">\(=\)</span> mass/volume.) The students record the mass lost by the solid substance and the volume of the gas that evaporated from it. They know that the mass lost by the solid must be the same as the mass of the gas that evaporated. (Source: Hunt and Sykes, 1984)</p>
