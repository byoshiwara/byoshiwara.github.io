<div class="para">The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> miles per hour, Francine’s flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at <span class="process-math">\(x = 15\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">What about negative values for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{?}\)</span> If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine’s flying time should decrease for negative <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(x = -5\text{,}\)</span> there is a tailwind of <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> miles per hour, so Francine’s effective speed is <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span>  miles per hour, and she can complete the flight in <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> hours. As the tailwind gets stronger (that is, as we move farther to the left in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-direction), Francine’s flying time continues to decrease, and the graph approaches the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Graphing-Rational-Functions.html#li-9167" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
