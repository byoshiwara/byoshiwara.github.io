<li><div class="para">The graph of <span class="process-math">\(r(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x + 1}{x^2}}\)</span> in figure (a) has a horizontal asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(y = 0\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, because the degree of the denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator. Higher powers of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> grow much more rapidly than smaller powers. Thus, for large values of <span class="process-math">\(\abs{x}\text{,}\)</span> the denominator is much larger in absolute value than the numerator of <span class="process-math">\(r(x)\text{,}\)</span> so the function values approach <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The graph of <span class="process-math">\(s(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x^2 - 4}{2x^2}}\)</span> in figure (b) has a horizontal asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(y = \dfrac{1}{2}\text{,}\)</span> because the numerator and denominator of the fraction have the same degree. For large values of <span class="process-math">\(\abs{x}\text{,}\)</span> the terms of lower degree are negligible compared to the squared terms. As <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases, <span class="process-math">\(s(x)\)</span> is approximately equal to <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{x^2}{2x^2}\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the function values approach a constant value of <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The graph of <span class="process-math">\(t(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1}}\)</span> in figure (c) does not have a horizontal asymptote, because the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. As <span class="process-math">\(\abs{x}\)</span> increases, <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + 1\)</span> grows much faster than <span class="process-math">\(x - 1\text{,}\)</span> so their ratio does not approach a constant value. The function values increase without bound.</div></li>
