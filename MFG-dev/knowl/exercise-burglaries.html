<p>In 1991, there were 64.6 burglaries per 1000 households in the United States. The number of burglaries reported annually declined at a roughly constant rate over the next decade, and in 2001 there were 28.7 burglaries per 1000 households. (Source: U.S. Department of Justice) </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>Find a function for the number of burglaries, \(B\text{,}\) as a function of time, \(t\text{,}\) in years, since 1990.</p></li>
<li><p>State the slope as a rate of change. What does the slope tell us about this problem?</p></li>
