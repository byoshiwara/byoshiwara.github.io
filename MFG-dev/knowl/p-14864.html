<p>The triangular matrix we obtain by row reduction is an example of <dfn class="terminology">row echelon form</dfn>. In a row echelon matrix,</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The first nonzero entry in any row is farther to the right than the first nonzero entry in the rows above it.</li>
<li>The entries directly below the first nonzero entry in any row are all zeros.</li>
<li>Any row consisting entirely of zeros is below all rows with any nonzero entry.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we divide each row by its leading nonzero entry, so that the leading entry is \(1\text{,}\) and if we use row reduction to obtain \(0\)s above the leading \(1\) as well as below it, the resulting matrix is said to be in <dfn class="terminology">reduced row echelon form</dfn>. This form is especially convenient because we do not have to use backsubstitution to finish solving the system; we can read off the solutions directly from the matrix.</p>
