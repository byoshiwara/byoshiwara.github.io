<p>The owner of a print shop volunteers to produce flyers for his candidate's campaign. His large printing press can complete the job in <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> hours, and the smaller model can finish the flyers in <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> hours. How long will it take to print the flyers if he runs both presses simultaneously?</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose that the large press can complete a job in <span class="process-math">\(t_1\)</span> hours and the smaller press takes <span class="process-math">\(t_2\)</span> hours. Write expressions for the fraction of a job that each press can complete in <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> hour.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an expression for the fraction of a job that can be completed in <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> hour with both presses running simultaneously.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an expression for the amount of time needed to complete the job with both presses running.</p></li>
<li><p>Write your answer to part (c) as a simple fraction.</p></li>
<li><p>Use your formula to answer the question stated in the problem.</p></li>
