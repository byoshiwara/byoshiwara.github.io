<p>A small pottery is setting up a workshop to produce mugs. Three machines are located on a long table, as shown in the figure. The potter must use each machine once in the course of producing a mug. Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> represent the coordinate of the potter's station.</p>

<li><p>Write and graph a new function for the sum of the potter's distances to the four machines.</p></li>

<p>Richard and Marian are moving to Parkville to take jobs after they graduate. The main road through Parkville runs east and west, crossing a river in the center of town. Richard's job is located <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> miles east of the river on the main road, and Marian's job is <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> miles west of the river. There is a health club they both like located <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> miles east of the river. If they plan to visit the health club every workday, where should Richard and Marian look for an apartment to minimize their total daily driving distance?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">60<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Romina's Bakery has just signed contracts to provide baked goods for three new restaurants located on Route 28 outside of town. The Coffee Stop is <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> miles north of town center, Sneaky Pete's is <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> miles north, and the Sea Shell is <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> miles south. Romina wants to open a branch bakery on Route 28 to handle the new business. Where should she locate the bakery in order to minimize the distance she must drive for deliveries?</p></article>
