<p>A small pottery is setting up a workshop to produce mugs. Three machines are located on a long table, as shown in the figure. The potter must use each machine once in the course of producing a mug. Let \(x\) represent the coordinate of the potter's station.</p>

<p>Suppose the pottery in Problem 57 adds a fourth machine to the procedure for producing a mug, located at \(x = 16\) in the figure.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write and graph a new function for the sum of the potter's distances to the four machines.</p></li>
<li><p>Where should the potter stand now to minimize the distance she has to walk while producing a mug?</p></li>

<p>Richard and Marian are moving to Parkville to take jobs after they graduate. The main road through Parkville runs east and west, crossing a river in the center of town. Richard's job is located \(10\) miles east of the river on the main road, and Marian's job is \(6\) miles west of the river. There is a health club they both like located \(2\) miles east of the river. If they plan to visit the health club every workday, where should Richard and Marian look for an apartment to minimize their total daily driving distance?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">60<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>Romina's Bakery has just signed contracts to provide baked goods for three new restaurants located on Route 28 outside of town. The Coffee Stop is \(2\) miles north of town center, Sneaky Pete's is \(8\) miles north, and the Sea Shell is \(12\) miles south. Romina wants to open a branch bakery on Route 28 to handle the new business. Where should she locate the bakery in order to minimize the distance she must drive for deliveries?</p></article>
