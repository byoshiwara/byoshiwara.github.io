<p>The Columbian ground squirrel eats forb, a type of flowering weed, and grass. One gram of forb provides \(2.44\) kilocalories, and one gram of grass provides \(2.26\) kilocalories. For survival, the squirrel needs at least \(100\) kilocalories per day. However, the squirrel can digest no more than \(314\) wet grams of food daily. Each dry gram of forb becomes \(2.67\) wet grams in the squirrel's stomach, and each dry gram of grass becomes \(1.64\) wet grams. In addition, the squirrel has at most \(342\) minutes available for grazing each day. It takes the squirrel \(2.05\) minutes to eat one gram of forb and \(5.21\) minutes to eat one gram of grass.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write a system of inequalities for the number of grams of grass and forb the squirrel can eat and survive.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Give two possible combinations of grass and forb that satisfy the squirrel's feeding requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>If the squirrel can find only grass on a given day, how much grass will it need to eat? If the squirrel can find only forb, how much forb will it need?</p></li>
</ol>
