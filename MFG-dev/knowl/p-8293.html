<p>Railroad engineers use a transition curve between straight sections of track and bends, which are designed as arcs of circles. The length, <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> of the transition curve varies directly with the cube of the train's speed, <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and inversely with the radius, <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> of the circular arc.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>On a section of track where the speed limit is <span class="process-math">\(50\)</span> mph, a circular bend has a radius of <span class="process-math">\(2000\)</span> feet, and the transition curve is <span class="process-math">\(200\)</span> feet long. Find the constant of variation and write a formula for <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If the speed limit is increased by <span class="process-math">\(20\%\text{,}\)</span> how is the length of the transition curve affected?</p></li>
<li><p>If the radius of the bend is increased by <span class="process-math">\(20\%\text{,}\)</span> how is the length of the transition curve affected?</p></li>
