<li><p>Fixed costs are given by \(C(0) = 250\text{,}\) or \(\$250\text{.}\) The fixed costs include expenses like utility bills that must be paid even if no magazines are produced.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The graph is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-GC-cubic-cost-function.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-GC-cubic-cost-function" alt="Figure 7.20 " title="Figure 7.20 ">Figure 7.20</a>a. It is increasing from a vertical intercept of \(250\text{.}\) The graph is concave down for \(x \lt 8\) approximately, and concave up for \(x\gt 8\text{.}\)</p>

<li>
<p>We must solve the equation</p>
\begin{equation*}
x^3 - 24x^2 + 195x + 250 = 1200
\end{equation*}
<p>We will solve the equation graphically, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-GC-cubic-cost-function.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-GC-cubic-cost-function" alt="Figure 7.20 " title="Figure 7.20 ">Figure 7.20</a>b. Graph \(y = 1200\) along with the cost function, and use the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>intersect</em> command to find the intersection point of the graphs, \((15.319, 1200)\text{.}\) \(C(x) = 1200\) when \(x\) is about \(15.319\text{,}\) so \(15,319\) copies can be printed for \(\$1200\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Although the cost is always increasing, it increases very slowly from about \(x = 5\) to about \(x = 11\text{.}\) The flattening of the graph in this interval is a result of economy of scale: By buying supplies in bulk and using time efficiently, the cost per magazine can be minimized. However, if the production level is too large, costs begin to rise rapidly again.</p></li>
