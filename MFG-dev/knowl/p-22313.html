<p>Gwynn is training for a triathlon. In her first week of training, she bicycled a total of 20 miles, then increased to 24 miles in her second week, 28 miles in her third week, and so on, increasing her mileage by 4 miles per week. Let \(m_n\) be Gwynn's mileage in her \(n^{\text{th}}\) week of training.  How many miles will she bicycle in her eighteenth week of training?</p>
