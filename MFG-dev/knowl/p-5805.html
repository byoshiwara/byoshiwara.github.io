<p>When a ship moves through the water, it creates waves that impede its own progress. Because of this resistance, there is an upper limit to the speed at which a ship can travel, given, in knots, by</p>
\begin{equation*}
v_{\text{max}}=1.3\sqrt{L} 
\end{equation*}
<p>where \(L\) is the length of the vessel, in feet. (Source: Gilner, 1972) </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>Graph maximum speed as a function of vessel length.</p></li>
<li><p>The world's largest ship, the oil tanker <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Jahre Viking</em>, is \(1054\) feet long. What is its top speed?</p></li>
<li><p>As a ship approaches its maximum speed, the power required increases sharply. Therefore, most merchant ships are designed to cruise at speeds no higher than \(v_c = 0.8\sqrt{L}\text{.}\) Graph \(v_c\) on the same axes with \(v_\text{max}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the cruising speed of the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Jahre Viking</em>? What percent of its maximum speed is that?</p></li>
