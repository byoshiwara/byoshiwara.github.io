<p>A company's monthly production, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> depends on the capital, <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> the company has invested and the amount of labor, <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> available each month. The Cobb-Douglas model for production assumes that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> varies jointly with <span class="process-math">\(C^a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L^b\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are positive constants less than <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> The Aztech Chip Company invested <span class="process-math">\(625\)</span> units of capital and hired <span class="process-math">\(256\)</span> workers and produces <span class="process-math">\(8000\)</span> computer chips each month.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(a = 0.25\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b = 0.75\text{.}\)</span> Find the constant of variation and a formula giving <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If Aztech increases its labor force to <span class="process-math">\(300\)</span> workers, what production level can they expect?</p></li>
<li><p>If Aztech maintains its labor force at <span class="process-math">\(256\)</span> workers, what amount of capital outlay would be required for monthly production to reach <span class="process-math">\(16,000\)</span> computer chips?</p></li>
