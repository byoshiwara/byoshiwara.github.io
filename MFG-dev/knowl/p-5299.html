<div class="para">Romina’s Bakery has just signed contracts to provide baked goods for three new restaurants located on Route 28 outside of town. The Coffee Stop is <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> miles north of town center, Sneaky Pete’s is <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> miles north, and the Sea Shell is <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> miles south. Romina wants to open a branch bakery on Route 28 to handle the new business. Where should she locate the bakery in order to minimize the distance she must drive for deliveries?</div>
