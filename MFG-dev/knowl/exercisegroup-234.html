<div class="para">Carbon-14 occurs in living organisms with a fixed ratio to nonradioactive carbon-12. After a plant or animal dies, the carbon-14 decays into stable carbon with a halflife of <span class="process-math">\(5730\)</span> years. When samples from the Shroud of Turin were analyzed in 1988, they were found to have <span class="process-math">\(91.2\%\)</span> of their original carbon-14. How old were those samples in 1988?</div></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">40<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<div class="para">Rubidium-strontium radioactive dating is used in geologic studies to measure the age of minerals. Rubidium-87 decays into strontium-87 with a half-life of <span class="process-math">\(48.8\)</span> billion years. Several meteors were found to have <span class="process-math">\(93.7\%\)</span> of their original rubidium.

<div class="para">Americium-241 (Am-241) is used in residential smoke detectors. Particles emitted as Am-241 decays cause the air in a smoke alarm to ionize, allowing current to flow between two electrodes. If smoke absorbs the particles, the current changes and sets off the alarm. The half-life of Am-241 is <span class="process-math">\(432\)</span> years. How long will it take for <span class="process-math">\(30\%\)</span> of the Am-241 to decay?</div></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">42<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<div class="para">Doctors can measure the amount of blood in a patient by injecting a known volume of red blood cells tagged with chromium-51. After allowing the blood to mix, they measure the percentage of tagged cells in a sample of the patient’s blood and use a proportion to compute the original blood volume. Chromium-51 has a half-life of <span class="process-math">\(27.7\)</span> days. How much of the original chromium-51 will still be present after <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> days?</div></article>
