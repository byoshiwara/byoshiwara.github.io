<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The term <dfn class="terminology">linear programming</dfn> was coined in the late 1940s. It describes a relatively young branch of mathematics, compared to subjects such as Euclidean geometry, where the major ideas were already well understood 23 centuries ago. (The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote what can be considered the first geometry textbook about 300 B.C.) Business managers routinely solve linear programming problems for purchasing and marketing strategy, so it is possible that linear programming affects your daily life as much as any other branch of mathematics.</p>
