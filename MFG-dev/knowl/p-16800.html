<p>The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at <span class="process-math">\(x = 15\text{.}\)</span></p>
