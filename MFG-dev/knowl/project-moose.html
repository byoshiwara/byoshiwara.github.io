<div class="para">The Isle Royale moose eats deciduous leaves, which provide <span class="process-math">\(3.01\)</span> kilocalories of energy per gram, and aquatic plants, which provide <span class="process-math">\(3.82\)</span> kilocalories per gram. The moose needs at least <span class="process-math">\(10,946\)</span> kilocalories of food per day, and its daily sodium requirement must be met by consuming at least <span class="process-math">\(453\)</span> grams of aquatic plants. It takes the moose <span class="process-math">\(0.05\)</span> minute to eat one gram of aquatic plants and <span class="process-math">\(0.06\)</span> minute to eat each gram of leaves. To maintain its thermal balance, the moose cannot spend more than <span class="process-math">\(150\)</span> minutes each day standing in water and eating aquatics plants, or more than <span class="process-math">\(256\)</span> minutes eating leaves. Each gram of aquatic plants becomes <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> wet grams in the moose’s stomach, and each gram of leaves becomes <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> wet grams, and the stomach can hold no more than <span class="process-math">\(32,900\)</span> wet grams of food daily.</div>
