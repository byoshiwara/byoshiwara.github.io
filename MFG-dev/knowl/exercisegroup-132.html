<p>Inga runs hot water into the bathtub until it is about half full. Because the water is too hot, she lets it sit for a while before getting into the tub. After several minutes of bathing, she gets out and drains the tub. Graph the water level in the bathtub as a function of time, from the moment Inga starts filling the tub until it is drained.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>David turns on the oven and it heats up steadily until the proper baking temperature is reached. The oven maintains that temperature during the time David bakes a pot roast. When he turns the oven off, David leaves the oven door open for a few minutes, and the temperature drops fairly rapidly during that time. After David closes the door, the temperature continues to drop, but at a much slower rate. Graph the temperature of the oven as a function of time, from the moment David first turns on the oven until shortly after David closes the door when the oven is cooling.</p></article>
