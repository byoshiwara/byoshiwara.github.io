<dl class="description-list">
<dt>absolute value</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the distance on the number line from a number to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> For example, the absolute value of <span class="process-math">\(-7\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(7\text{.}\)</span> This fact is expressed by the equation <span class="process-math">\(\abs{-7} = 7\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>absolute value equation</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an equation in which the variable occurs between the absolute value bars.</p></dd>
<dt>absolute value inequality</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an inequality in which the variable occurs between the absolute value bars.</p></dd>
<dt>algebraic expression</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a meaningful combination of numbers, variables, and operation symbols. Also called an <dfn class="terminology">expression</dfn>.</p></dd>
<dt>algebraic fraction</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a fraction whose numerator and denominator are polynomials. Also called a <dfn class="terminology">rational expression</dfn>.</p></dd>
<dt>algebraic solution</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a method for solving equations (or inequalities) by manipulating the equations (or inequalities). Compare with <dfn class="terminology">graphical solution</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">numerical solution</dfn>.</p></dd>
<dt>allometric equation</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an equation showing the (approximate) relationship between a living organism's body mass and another of the organism's properties or processes, usually given in the form <span class="process-math">\(y = k (\text{mass})^p\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>altitude</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, (i) the distance above the ground or above sea level; (ii) the vertical distance between the base and the opposite vertex of a triangle, pyramid, or cone; (iii) the distance between parallel sides of a parallelogram, trapezoid, or rectangle. Also called <dfn class="terminology">height</dfn>.</p></dd>
<dt>amortization</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the payment of a debt through regular installments over a period of time.</p></dd>
<dt>amount</dt>
<dd><p>(in an interest-bearing account), <dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the sum of the principal that was invested and all the interest earned.</p></dd>

<dt>approximation</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an inexact result.</p></dd>
<dt>area</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a measure of the two-dimensional space enclosed by a polygon or curve, typically expressed in terms of square units, such as square meters or square feet, etc.</p></dd>
<dt>ascending powers</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an ordering of the terms of a polynomial so that the exponents on the variable are increasing, such as in the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(1 + x + x^2\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>associative law of addition</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the property that when adding three or more terms, the grouping of terms does not affect the sum. We express this formally by saying that if <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> are any numbers, then <span class="process-math">\((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>associative law of multiplication</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the property that when multiplying three or more factors, the grouping of factors does not affect the product. We express this formally by saying that if <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> are any numbers, then <span class="process-math">\((a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>asymptote</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a reference line (or curve) towards which the graph of an equation tends as the value of x and/or y grows or diminishes without bound.</p></dd>
<dt>augmented matrix (for a linear systterm with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> variables in standard form),</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the matrix obtained by making each row of the matrix correspond to an equation of the systterm, with the coefficients of the variables filling the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns, and the last (that is, the <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span>) column having the constants.</p></dd>
<dt>axis</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, (<dfn class="terminology">plural</dfn> <dfn class="terminology">axes</dfn>), a line used as a reference for position and/or orientation.</p></dd>
<dt>axis of symmetry</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a line that cuts a plane figure into two parts, each a mirror image of the other.</p></dd>
