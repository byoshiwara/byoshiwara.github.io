<p><a knowl="./knowl/project-ground-squirrel.html" title="Project 8.8: Ground Squirrels">Project 8.8</a> described the diet of the Colombian ground squirrel. Refer to the system of constraints and the set of feasible solutions you found in that problem.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write a formula for the squirrel’s energy consumption. What is the optimum diet for the squirrel if it wants to maximize its energy consumption? Round your answers to one decimal place.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a formula for the squirrel's foraging time. What is the optimum diet for the squirrel if it wants to minimize its time foraging? Round your answer to one decimal place.</p></li>
<li><p>The actual observed diet of the squirrel consists of approximately \(100\) grams of forb and \(25\) grams of grass. Does the squirrel appear to be trying to maximize its caloric intake or to minimize its time eating? (Because \(70\%\) of the food available to the squirrel is grass, its diet is not determined by convenience.)</p></li>
