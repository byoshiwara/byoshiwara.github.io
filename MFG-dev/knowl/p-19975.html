<p>In this chapter, we use a graphing technique to solve problems in two unknowns. For example, the diet of the Columbian ground squirrel consists of two foods: grass and forb (a type of flowering weed). Small animals spend most of their time foraging for food, but they must also be alert for predators. Which foraging strategy favors survival: Should the squirrel try to satisfy its dietary requirements in minimum time, thus minimizing its exposure to predators and the elements, or should it try to maximize its intake of nutrients?</p>
