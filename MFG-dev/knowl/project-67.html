<p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is very accurate, but it depends on perfectly synchronized clocks. An older navigational system, called LORAN (Long Range Navigation), is still used by sailors to locate their position at sea.  The system works by finding the intersection of two hyperbolas.</p>
<p>Radio transmitters at known positions broadcast signals simultaneously, and the navigator notes the difference in the arrival times of the two signals. (This difference is calculated using only the navigator's clock, and does not depend on the time when the signals were transmitted.) From the time difference the navigator computes the difference in the distances to the two transmitters, using the speed of radio waves.</p>

<p>We know that a hyperbola is the set of all points in the plane for which the difference of the distances from two fixed points is a constant.  Thus, the navigator's position lies on a hyperbola with the two transmitters as the foci, as shown above.  A third transmitter signal compared with either of the first two determines a second hyperbola.  The navigator's position must be at the intersection of the two hyperbolas.</p>
<p>Your ship receives LORAN signals from transmitters located at \(A(0,28),~ B(0,-28)\text{,}\) and \(C(-120, -28)\text{.}\) You calculate that you are 14 kilometers closer to \(A\) than to \(B\text{,}\) and 72 kilometers closer to \(B\) than to \(C\text{.}\) It follows that your position must lie on the hyperbolas</p>
