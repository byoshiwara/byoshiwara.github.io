<div class="para">A farmer has <span class="process-math">\(1300\)</span> acres on which to plant wheat, corn, and soybeans. The seed costs $<span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> for an acre of wheat, $<span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> for an acre of corn, and $<span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> for an acre of soybeans. An acre of wheat requires <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> acre-feet of water during the growing season, while an acre of corn requires <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> acre-feet and an acre of soybeans requires <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> acre-feet. If the farmer has $<span class="process-math">\(6150\)</span> to spend on seed and can count on <span class="process-math">\(3800\)</span> acre-feet of water, how many acres of each crop should he plant in order to use all his resources?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Systems-of-Linear-Equations-in-Three-Variables.html#exercise-3386" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
