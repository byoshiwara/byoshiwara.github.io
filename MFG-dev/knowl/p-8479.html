<p>Manufacturers of ships (and other complex products) find that the average cost of producing a ship decreases as more of those ships are produced. This relationship is called the <dfn class="terminology">experience curve</dfn>, given by the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C = ax^{-b}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is the average cost per ship in millions of dollars and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the number of ships produced. The value of the constant <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> depends on the complexity of the ship. (Source: Storch, Hammon, and Bunch, 1988)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What is the significance of the constant of proportionality <span class="process-math">\(a\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For one kind of ship, <span class="process-math">\(b = \dfrac{1}{8}\text{,}\)</span> and the cost of producing the first ship is $<span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> million. Write the equation for <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> using radical notation.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the cost per ship when <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> ships have been built. By what percent does the cost per ship decrease? By what percent does the cost per ship decrease from building <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> ships to building <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> ships?</p></li>
<li><p>By what percent does the average cost decrease from building <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> ships to building <span class="process-math">\(2n\)</span> ships? (In the shipbuilding industry, the average cost per ship usually decreases by <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(10\%\)</span> each time the number of ships doubles.)</p></li>
