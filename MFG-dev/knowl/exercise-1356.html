<p>The gourd species <em class="emphasis">Tricosanthes</em> grows according to the formula <span class="process-math">\(L = ad^{2.2}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span>  is its length and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is its width. The species <em class="emphasis">Lagenaria</em> has the growth law <span class="process-math">\(L = ad^{0.81}\text{.}\)</span> (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>By comparing the exponents, predict which gourd grows into a long, thin shape, and which is relatively fatter. Which species is called the snake gourd, and which is the bottle gourd?</p></li>
<li><p>The snake gourd reaches a length of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> meters (<span class="process-math">\(200\)</span> cm), with a diameter of only <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> cm. Find the value of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in its growth law.</p></li>
<li><p>The bottle gourd is <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> cm long and <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> cm in diameter at maturity. Find the value of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in its growth law.</p></li>
<li><p>The giant bottle gourd grows to a length of <span class="process-math">\(23\)</span> cm with a diameter of <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> cm. Does it grow according to the same law as standard bottle gourds?</p></li>
