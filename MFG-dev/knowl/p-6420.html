<p>“The density to which matter must be squeezed [to create a black hole] scales as the inverse square of the mass. For a hole with the mass of the Sun, the density is about <span class="process-math">\(10^9\)</span> kilograms per cubic meter, higher than that of an atomic nucleus.”</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Recall that the density of an object is its mass per unit volume. Given that the mass of the sun is about <span class="process-math">\(2\times 10^{30}\)</span> kilograms, write a formula for the density, <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> of a black hole as a function of its mass, <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>“The known laws of physics allow for a matter density up to the so-called Planck value of <span class="process-math">\(10^{97}\)</span> kilograms per cubic meter.” If a black hole with this density could be created, it would be the smallest possible black hole. What would its mass be?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that a black hole is spherical, what would be the radius of the smallest possible black hole?</p></li>
