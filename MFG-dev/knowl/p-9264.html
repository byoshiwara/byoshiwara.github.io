<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>You would like to borrow $\(100,000\) for \(20\) years. What interest rate, to the nearest percent, can you accept if your monthly payments must be no more than $\(800\text{?}\) What interest rate can you accept if the loan is for \(30\) years? If \(P = f (r, t)\text{,}\) use function notation to write both of these questions as inequalities.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you borrow $\(100,000\) for \(10\) years at \(10\%\) interest. Which would cause a greater reduction in your monthly payment: Reducing the interest rate by \(5\%\) or increasing the length of the loan by \(5\) years?</p></li>
<li><p>At a fixed interest rate of \(8\%\text{,}\) is the monthly payment a linear function of the length of the loan?</p></li>
<li><p>For a fixed loan period of \(25\) years, is the monthly payment a linear function of interest rate?</p></li>
<li><p>Does a \(1\%\) increase in the interest rate have a greater affect on the monthly payment for a \(15\)-year loan or a \(30\)-year loan?</p></li>
