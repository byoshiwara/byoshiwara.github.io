<p>In the Middle Ages in Europe, castles were built as defensive strongholds. An attacking force would build a huge catapult called a trebuchet to hurl rocks and scrap metal inside the castle walls. The engineers could adjust its range by varying the mass of the projectiles. The mass, <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> of the projectile should be inversely proportional to the square of the distance, <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> to the target.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Use a negative exponent to write <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(m = f (d)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The engineers test the trebuchet with a <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span>-kilogram projectile, which lands <span class="process-math">\(250\)</span> meters away. Find the constant of proportionality; then rewrite your formula for <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Graph <span class="process-math">\(m = f (d)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The trebuchet is <span class="process-math">\(180\)</span> meters from the courtyard within the castle. What size projectile will hit the target?</p></li>
<li><p>The attacking force would like to hurl a <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span>-kilogram projectile at the castle. How close must the attackers bring their trebuchet?</p></li>
