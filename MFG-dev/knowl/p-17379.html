<p>Shortly after the arrival of human beings at the Hawaiian islands around 400 A.D., many species of birds became extinct. Fossils of <span class="process-math">\(29\)</span> different species have been found, but some species may have left no fossils for us to find. We can estimate the total number of extinct species using a proportion. Of <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> species that are still alive, biologists have found fossil evidence of <span class="process-math">\(7\text{.}\)</span> (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
