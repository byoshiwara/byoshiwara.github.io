<div class="para">In his hiking guidebook, <span class="booktitle">Afoot and Afield in Los Angeles County</span>, Jerry Schad notes that the number of people on a wilderness trail is inversely proportional to "the square of the distance and the cube of the elevation gain from the nearest road."</div>

<div class="para">On a sunny Saturday afternoon, you count <span class="process-math">\(42\)</span> people enjoying the Rock Pool at Malibu Creek State Park. The Rock Pool is <span class="process-math">\(1.5\)</span> miles from the main parking lot, and the trail includes an elevation gain of <span class="process-math">\(250\)</span> feet. Calculate the constant of variation in your formula from part (a).</div>
