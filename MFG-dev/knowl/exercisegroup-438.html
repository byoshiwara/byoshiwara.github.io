Paperback textbooks will be sold for $<span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and the hardcover textbooks will be sold for $<span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> If paperback texts weigh <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> pounds each and hardcover books weigh <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> pounds each, find the minimum weight of textbooks the department must sell in order to raise its required funds.</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">21<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Jeannette has <span class="process-math">\(180\)</span> acres of farmland for growing wheat or soy. Each acre of wheat requires two hours of labor at harvest time, and each acre of soy needs one hour of labor. Jeannette will have <span class="process-math">\(240\)</span> hours of labor available at harvest time. Find the maximum profit Jeannette can make from her two crops if she can get a profit of $<span class="process-math">\(36\)</span> per acre for wheat and $<span class="process-math">\(24\)</span> per acre for soy.</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">22<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Vassilis has at most $<span class="process-math">\(10,000\)</span> to invest in two banks.

<p>Gary's pancake recipe includes corn meal and whole wheat flour. Corn meal has <span class="process-math">\(2.4\)</span> grams of linoleic acid and <span class="process-math">\(2.5\)</span> milligrams of niacin per cup. Whole wheat flour has <span class="process-math">\(0.8\)</span> gram of linoleic acid and <span class="process-math">\(5.2\)</span> milligrams of niacin per cup. These two dry ingredients do not exceed <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> cups total. They combine for at least <span class="process-math">\(3.2\)</span> grams of linoleic acid and at least <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> milligrams of niacin. Minimize the number of calories possible in the recipe if corn meal has <span class="process-math">\(433\)</span> calories per cup and whole wheat flour has <span class="process-math">\(400\)</span> calories per cup.</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">24<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
