<p>The math club is selling tickets for a show by a mathemagician. Student tickets will cost \(\$1\) and faculty tickets will cost \(\$2\text{.}\) The ticket receipts must be at least \(\$250\) to cover the fee for the performer. An alumna promises to donate one calculator for each student ticket sold and three calculators for each faculty ticket sold. What is the minimum number of calculators that the alumna will donate?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">20</span></h5>
<p>The math department is having a book sale of unwanted textbooks to raise funds for \(\$300\) in scholarships. Paperback textbooks will be sold for \(\$2\) and the hardcover textbooks will be sold for \(\$5\text{.}\) If paperback texts weigh \(2\) pounds each and hardcover books weigh \(3\) pounds each, find the minimum weight of textbooks the department must sell in order to raise its required funds.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">21</span></h5>
<p>Jeannette has \(180\) acres of farmland for growing wheat or soy. Each acre of wheat requires two hours of labor at harvest time, and each acre of soy needs one hour of labor. Jeannette will have \(240\) hours of labor available at harvest time. Find the maximum profit Jeannette can make from her two crops if she can get a profit of \(\$36\) per acre for wheat and \(\$24\) per acre for soy.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">22</span></h5>
<p>Vassilis has at most \(\$10,000\) to invest in two banks. Alpha Bank will pay \(6\%\) annual interest and Bank Beta pays \(5\%\) annual interest. Alpha Bank will only insure up to \(\$6000\text{,}\) so Vassilis will invest no more than that with Alpha. What is the maximum amount of interest Vassilis can earn in \(1\) year?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">23</span></h5>
<p>Gary's pancake recipe includes corn meal and whole wheat flour. Corn meal has \(2.4\) grams of linoleic acid and \(2.5\) milligrams of niacin per cup. Whole wheat flour has \(0.8\) gram of linoleic acid and \(5.2\) milligrams of niacin per cup. These two dry ingredients do not exceed \(3\) cups total. They combine for at least \(3.2\) grams of linoleic acid and at least \(10\) milligrams of niacin. Minimize the number of calories possible in the recipe if corn meal has \(433\) calories per cup and whole wheat flour has \(400\) calories per cup.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">24</span></h5>
<p>Cho requires \(1\) hour of cutting and \(2\) hours of sewing to make a Batman costume. He requires \(2\) hours of cutting and \(1\) hour of sewing to make a Wonder Woman costume.
