<p>A brewery wants to replace its old vats with larger ones. To estimate the cost of the new equipment, the accountant uses the <span class="process-math">\(0.6\)</span> rule for industrial costs, which states that the cost of a new container is approximately <span class="process-math">\(N = Cr^{0.6}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is the cost of the old container and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the ratio of the capacity of the new container to the old one.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If an old vat cost $<span class="process-math">\(5000\text{,}\)</span> graph <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>How much should the accountant budget for a new vat that holds <span class="process-math">\(1.8\)</span> times as much as the old one?</p></li>
