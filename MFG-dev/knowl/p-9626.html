<div class="para">Carbon dioxide (<span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span>) is called a greenhouse gas because it traps part of the Earthâ€™s outgoing energy. Animals release <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> into the atmosphere, and plants remove <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> through photosynthesis. In modern times, deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels both contribute to <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> levels. The figure shows atmospheric concentrations of <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\text{,}\)</span> in parts per million, measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.</div>

<li><div class="para">The red curve shows annual oscillations in <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> levels. Can you explain why <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> levels vary throughout the year?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The blue curve shows the average annual <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> readings. By approximately how much does the <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> level vary from its average value during the year?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In 1960, the average <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> level was <span class="process-math">\(316.75\)</span> parts per million, and the average level has been rising by <span class="process-math">\(0.4\%\)</span> per year. If the level continues to rise at this rate, what <span class="process-math">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> readings can we expect in the year 2100?</div></li>
