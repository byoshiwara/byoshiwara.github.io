<div class="para">Because the scale shows the weight as <span class="process-math">\(6.0\)</span> grams, we know that the true weight of the sample must be between <span class="process-math">\(5.95\)</span> grams and <span class="process-math">\(6.05\)</span> grams: If the weight were less than <span class="process-math">\(5.95\)</span> grams, the scale would round down to <span class="process-math">\(5.9\)</span> grams, and if the weight were more than <span class="process-math">\(6.05\)</span> grams, the scale would round up to <span class="process-math">\(6.1\)</span> grams. We should report the mass of the sample as <span class="process-math">\(6 \pm 0.05\)</span> grams, which tells the reader that the error in the measurement is no more than <span class="process-math">\(0.05\)</span> grams.</div>
