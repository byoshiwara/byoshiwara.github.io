<li><p>You would like to borrow $<span class="process-math">\(100,000\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> years. What interest rate, to the nearest percent, can you accept if your monthly payments must be no more than $<span class="process-math">\(800\text{?}\)</span> What interest rate can you accept if the loan is for <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span> years? If <span class="process-math">\(P = f (r, t)\text{,}\)</span> use function notation to write both of these questions as inequalities.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you borrow $<span class="process-math">\(100,000\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> years at <span class="process-math">\(10\%\)</span> interest. Which would cause a greater reduction in your monthly payment: Reducing the interest rate by <span class="process-math">\(5\%\)</span> or increasing the length of the loan by <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> years?</p></li>
<li><p>At a fixed interest rate of <span class="process-math">\(8\%\text{,}\)</span> is the monthly payment a linear function of the length of the loan?</p></li>
<li><p>For a fixed loan period of <span class="process-math">\(25\)</span> years, is the monthly payment a linear function of interest rate?</p></li>
<li><p>Does a <span class="process-math">\(1\%\)</span> increase in the interest rate have a greater affect on the monthly payment for a <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span>-year loan or a <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span>-year loan?</p></li>
