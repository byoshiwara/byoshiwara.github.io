<p>Railroad engineers use a transition curve between straight sections of track and bends, which are designed as arcs of circles. The length, \(L\text{,}\) of the transition curve varies directly with the cube of the train's speed, \(v\text{,}\) and inversely with the radius, \(R\text{,}\) of the circular arc. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>On a section of track where the speed limit is \(50\) mph, a circular bend has a radius of \(2000\) feet, and the transition curve is \(200\) feet long. Find the constant of variation and write a formula for \(L\) as a function of \(v\) and \(R\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If the speed limit is increased by \(20\%\text{,}\) how is the length of the transition curve affected?</p></li>
<li><p>If the radius of the bend is increased by \(20\%\text{,}\) how is the length of the transition curve affected?</p></li>
