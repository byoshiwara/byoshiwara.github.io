<p>The incubation time for a bird's egg is a function of the mass, \(m\text{,}\) of the egg, and has been experimentally determined as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
I(m) = 12.0m^{0.217}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(m\) is measured in grams and \(I\) is in days. (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Calculate the incubation time (to the nearest day) for the wren, whose eggs weigh about \(2.5\) grams, and the greylag goose, whose eggs weigh \(46\) grams.</p></li>
<li>
<p>During incubation, birds' eggs lose water vapor through their porous shells. The rate of water loss from the egg is also a function of its mass, and it appears to follow the rule</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
W(m) = 0.015m^{0.742}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>in grams per day. Combine the functions \(I(m)\) and \(W(m)\) to calculate the fraction of the initial egg mass that is lost during the entire incubation period.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explain why your result shows that most eggs lose about \(18\%\) of their mass during incubation.</p></li>
