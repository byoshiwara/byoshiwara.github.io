<p>A rowing team can maintain a speed of <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> miles per hour in still water. The team's daily training session includes a <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span>-mile run up the Red Cedar River and the return downstream.</p>

<p>Two pilots for the Flying Express parcel service receive packages simultaneously. Orville leaves Boston for Chicago at the same time Wilbur leaves Chicago for Boston. Each selects an airspeed of <span class="process-math">\(400\)</span> miles per hour for the <span class="process-math">\(900\)</span>-mile trip. The prevailing winds blow from east to west.</p>

<p>On New Year's Day, a blimp leaves its berth in Carson, California, and heads north for the Rose Bowl, <span class="process-math">\(23\)</span> miles away. There is a breeze from the north at <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> miles per hour.</p>
