<p>Ivana is investing in the hotel business. She has bought two hotels, and she will expand her investments when her total profit from the two hotels exceeds $\(10,000\text{.}\) If we let \(x\) represent the profit from one hotel and let \(y\) represent the profit from the other, then Ivana will expand her investments when</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x + y \ge 10,000
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Notice that the equation \(x + y = 10,000\) is not appropriate to model our situation, since Ivana will be delighted if her profits are not exactly equal to $\(10,000\) but actually exceed that amount.</p>
