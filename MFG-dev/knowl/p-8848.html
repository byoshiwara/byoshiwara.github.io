<p>A solar energy company sold $<span class="process-math">\(80,000\)</span> worth of solar collectors last year, its first year of operation. This year its sales rose to $<span class="process-math">\(88,000\text{,}\)</span> an increase of <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span>%. The marketing department must estimate its projected sales for the next <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> years.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow linearly, what should it expect the sales total to be next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> years, assuming that sales will grow linearly.</p></li>
<li><p>If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow exponentially, what should it expect the sales total to be next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> years, assuming that sales will grow exponentially.</p></li>
