<li><p>Each point on your graph represents a particular rectangle with perimeter <span class="process-math">\(36\)</span> inches. The first coordinate of the point gives the base of the rectangle, and the second coordinate gives the area of the rectangle. What is the largest area you found among rectangles with perimeter <span class="process-math">\(36\)</span> inches? What is the base for that rectangle? What is its height?</p></li>
<li><p>Give the dimensions of the rectangle that corresponds to the point <span class="process-math">\((13, 65)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Find two points on your graph with vertical coordinate <span class="process-math">\(80\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If the rectangle has area <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> square inches, what is its base? Why are there two different answers? Describe the rectangle corresponding to each answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we will write an algebraic expression for the area of the rectangle in terms of its base. Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> represent the base of the rectangle. First, express the height of the rectangle in terms of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> (Hint: If the perimeter of the rectangle is <span class="process-math">\(36\)</span> inches, what is the sum of the base and the height?) Now write an expression for the area of the rectangle in terms of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Use your formula from part (5) to compute the area of the rectangle when the base is <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> inches. Does your answer agree with the values in your table and the point on your graph?</p></li>
<li><p>Use your formula to compute the area of the rectangle when <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\)</span> and when <span class="process-math">\(x = 18\text{.}\)</span> Describe the rectangles that correspond to these data points.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue your graph to include the points corresponding to <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = 18\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
