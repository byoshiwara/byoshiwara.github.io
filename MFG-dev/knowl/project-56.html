<p><a knowl="./knowl/project-moose.html" title="Project 8.9: Isle Royale Moose">ProjectÂ 8.9</a> described the diet of the Isle Royale moose. Refer to the system of constraints and the set of feasible solutions you found in that problem.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write a formula for the moose's energy consumption. What is the optimum diet for the moose if it wants to maximize its energy consumption? Round your answers to one decimal place.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a formula for the moose's foraging time. What is the optimum diet for the moose if it wants to minimize its time foraging? Round your answer to one decimal place.</p></li>
<li><p>The actual observed diet of the moose consists of approximately \(868\) grams of aquatic plants and \(3437\) grams of leaves. Does the moose appear to be trying to maximize its caloric intake or to minimize its time eating?</p></li>
