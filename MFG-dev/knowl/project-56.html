<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/project-moose.html" title="Project 8.9: Isle Royale Moose">ProjectÂ 8.9</a> described the diet of the Isle Royale moose. Refer to the system of constraints and the set of feasible solutions you found in that problem.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write a formula for the moose's energy consumption. What is the optimum diet for the moose if it wants to maximize its energy consumption? Round your answers to one decimal place.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a formula for the moose's foraging time. What is the optimum diet for the moose if it wants to minimize its time foraging? Round your answer to one decimal place.</p></li>
<li><p>The actual observed diet of the moose consists of approximately <span class="process-math">\(868\)</span> grams of aquatic plants and <span class="process-math">\(3437\)</span> grams of leaves. Does the moose appear to be trying to maximize its caloric intake or to minimize its time eating?</p></li>
