<li><p>The graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 2^x + 3\text{,}\)</span> shown in figure (b), has the same basic shape as that of <span class="process-math">\(h(x) = 2^x\text{,}\)</span> but it has a horizontal asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(y = 3\)</span> instead of at <span class="process-math">\(y = 0\)</span> (the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis). In fact, <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = h(x) + 3\text{,}\)</span> so the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a vertical translation of the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> units. If every point on the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h(x) = 2^x\)</span> is moved <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> units upward, the result is the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f (x) = 2^x + 3\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>First note that <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = 2^x+3 = h(x + 3)\text{.}\)</span> In fact, the graph of <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = 2^{x+3}\)</span> shown in figure (c) has the same basic shape as <span class="process-math">\(h(x) = 2^x\)</span> but has been translated <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> units to the left.</p></li>
