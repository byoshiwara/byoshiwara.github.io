We estimate that Earth formed <span class="process-math">\(5000\)</span> million years ago.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The extinction of the dinosaurs is plotted between <span class="process-math">\(10^1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(10^2\text{,}\)</span> or between <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> million years ago. Because the point is closer to <span class="process-math">\(10^2\text{,}\)</span> we estimate their extinction at <span class="process-math">\(70\)</span> million years ago.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The last ice age is plotted just after <span class="process-math">\(10^{-2}\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(0.01\)</span> million years ago. One-hundredth of a million is <span class="process-math">\(10,000\text{,}\)</span> so we estimate that the ice age occurred a little more than <span class="process-math">\(10,000\)</span> years ago.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Crusades occurred about <span class="process-math">\(10^{-3}\text{,}\)</span> or about <span class="process-math">\(0.001\)</span> million years ago. One-thousandth of a million is <span class="process-math">\(1000\text{,}\)</span> so the Crusades occurred about <span class="process-math">\(1000\)</span> years ago, or about <span class="process-math">\(1000\)</span> A.D.</div></li>
