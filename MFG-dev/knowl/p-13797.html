<p>All these parabolas share certain features.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The graph has either a highest point (if the parabola opens downward, as in figure (a) or a lowest point (if the parabola opens upward, as in figure (b). This high or low point is called the <dfn class="terminology">vertex</dfn> of the graph.</p></li>
<li><p>The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line, called the <dfn class="terminology">axis of symmetry</dfn>, that runs through the vertex.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-intercept is the point where the parabola intersects the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis. The graph of a quadratic function always has exactly one <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-<dfn class="terminology">intercept</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the graph may cross the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis at one point, at two points, or not at all. Points where the parabola intersects the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis are called the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-<dfn class="terminology">intercepts</dfn>. If there are two <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-intercepts, they are equidistant from the axis of symmetry.</p></li>
<li><p>The values of the constants <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> determine the location and orientation of the parabola. We will begin by considering each of these constants separately.</p></li>
