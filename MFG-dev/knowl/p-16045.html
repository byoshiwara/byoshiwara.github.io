<p>The reprographics department has a choice of 2 new copying machines. One sells for $20,000 and costs $0.02 per copy to operate. The other sells for $17,500, but its operating costs are $0.025 per copy. The repro department decides to buy the more expensive machine. How many copies must the repro department make before the higher price is justified? </p>
