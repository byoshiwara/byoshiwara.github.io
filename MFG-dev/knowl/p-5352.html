<div class="para">From the table, we see that articles of any weight up to <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> ounce require $0.47 postage. This means that for all <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span>-values greater than <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> but less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-value is <span class="process-math">\(0.47\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the graph of <span class="process-math">\(p = g(w)\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(w = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(w = 1\)</span> looks like a small piece of the horizontal line <span class="process-math">\(p = 0.47\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Similarly, for all <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span>-values greater than <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> but less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-value is <span class="process-math">\(0.68\text{,}\)</span> so the graph on this interval looks like a small piece of the line <span class="process-math">\(p = 0.68\text{.}\)</span> Continue in this way to obtain the graph shown below.</div>

<div class="para">The open circles at the left endpoint of each horizontal segment indicate that that point is not included in the graph; the closed circles are points on the graph. For instance, if <span class="process-math">\(w = 3\text{,}\)</span> the postage, <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> is $0.89, not $1.10. Consequently, the point <span class="process-math">\((3, 0.89)\)</span> is part of the graph of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> but the point <span class="process-math">\((3, 1.10)\)</span> is not.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">Postage rates are given for all weights greater than <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> ounces up to and including <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> ounces, so the domain of the function is the half-open interval <span class="process-math">\((0, 7]\text{.}\)</span> (The domain is an interval because there is a point on the graph for every <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span>-value from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(7\text{.}\)</span>)</div>
<div class="para">The range of the function is not an interval, however, because the possible values for <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> do not include all the real numbers between <span class="process-math">\(0.3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1.75\text{.}\)</span> The range is the set of discrete values <span class="process-math">\(0.47\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(0.68\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(0.89\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(1.10\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(1.31\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(1.52\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1.73\text{.}\)</span>
