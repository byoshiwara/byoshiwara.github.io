<div class="para">Galileo had no accurate way to measure time; clocks had not been invented yet. So he used water running into a jar to mark equal time intervals. After many trials, Galileo found that the ball traveled <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> unit of distance down the plane in the first time interval, <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> units in the second time interval, <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> units in the third time interval, and so on, as shown in the figure, with the distances increasing through odd units of distance as time went on.</div>
