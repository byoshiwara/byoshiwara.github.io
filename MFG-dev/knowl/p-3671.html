<p>The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-home-to-school.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-home-to-school" alt="Figure 2.89 " title="Figure 2.89 ">Figure 2.89</a>a. It begins at the origin because at the instant Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when \(t = 0, y = 0\text{.}\)) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrest’s walking speed.</p>

<li><p>The graph begins like the graph in part (a). But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-home-to-school.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-home-to-school" alt="Figure 2.89 " title="Figure 2.89 ">Figure 2.89</a>b. The line has slope \(0\) because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is \(0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The graph begins like the graph in part (b). The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-home-to-school.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-home-to-school" alt="Figure 2.89 " title="Figure 2.89 ">Figure 2.89</a>c.</p></li>
