<p>An architect is planning to include a rectangular window topped by a semicircle in his plans for a new house, as shown in the figure. In order to admit enough light, the window should have an area of \(120\) square feet. The architect wants the rectangular portion of the window to be \(2\) feet wider than it is tall.</p>
