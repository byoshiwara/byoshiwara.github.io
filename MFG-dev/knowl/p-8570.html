<div class="para">The tone produced by a vibrating string depends on the frequency of the vibration. The frequency in turn depends on the length of the string, its weight, and its tension. In 1636, Marin Mersenne quantified these relationships as follows. The frequency, <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> of the vibration is</div>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><div class="para">inversely proportional to the string’s length, <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span>
