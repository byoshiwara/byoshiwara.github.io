<p>A chartered sightseeing flight over the Grand Canyon is scheduled to return to its departure point in <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> hours. The pilot would like to cover a distance of <span class="process-math">\(144\)</span> miles before turning around, and he hears on the Weather Service that there will be a headwind of <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> miles per hour on the outward journey.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Express the time it takes for the outward journey as a function of the airspeed of the plane.</p></li>
<li><p>Express the time it takes for the return journey as a function of the speed of the plane.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the sum of the two functions and find the point on the graph with <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-coordinate <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span> Interpret the coordinates of the point in the context of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The pilot would like to know what airspeed to maintain in order to complete the tour in <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> hours. Write an equation to describe this situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve your equation to find the appropriate airspeed.</p></li>
