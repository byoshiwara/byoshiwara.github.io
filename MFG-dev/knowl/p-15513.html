<p>Charles's law says that the temperature of a gas is related to its volume by a linear equation. A gas that occupied one liter at \(0\degree\)C expanded to \(1.2\) liters at a temperature of \(54.6\degree\)C. A second sample of gas that occupied \(2\) liters at \(0\degree\)C expanded to \(2.8\) liters at \(109.2\degree\)C.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find a linear equation for temperature, \(T\text{,}\) in terms of volume, \(V\text{,}\) for the first sample of gas, and a second linear equation for the second sample of gas.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the system of equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the system. What is the significance of the intersection point?</p></li>
<li><p>Show that both equations from part (a) can be written in the form \(T = c\left(\dfrac{V}{V_0}-1 \right)\text{,}\) where \(V_0\) is the volume of the gas at \(0\degree\)C.</p></li>
