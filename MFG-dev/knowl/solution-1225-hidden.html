<p>From the definition we see that the first few terms of the sequence are 2, 5, 8, and 11. Because each new term is found by adding 3 to the previous term, we see that this is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.  This means that the sequence has the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a_n = 2 + (n-1)3~~~\text{or}~~~~a_n = 3n - 1
\end{equation*}
</div>

<p>The first four terms of this sequence are 2, 6, 18, and 54. Because each new term is found by multiplying the previous term by 3, we see that this is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3. This means that the sequence has the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
b_n = 3\cdot 2^{n-1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
