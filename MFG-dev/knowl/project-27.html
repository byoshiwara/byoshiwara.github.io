<p>Do hedgerows planted at the boundaries of a field have a good or bad effect on crop yields? Hedges provide some shelter for the crops and retain moisture, but they may compete for nutrients or create too much shade. Results of studies on the microclimates produced by hedges are summarized in the figure, which shows how crop yields increase or decrease as a function of distance from the hedgerow. (Source: Briggs, David, and Courtney, 1985)</p>

<li><p>We will use trial-and-improvement to fit a curve to the graph. First, graph <span class="process-math">\(y_1 = xe^{-x}\)</span> in the window <span class="process-math">\(\text{Xmin} = -2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\text{Xmax} = 5\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\text{Ymin} = -1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\text{Ymax} = 1\)</span> to see that it has the right shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph <span class="process-math">\(y_2 = (x - 2)e^{-(x-2)}\)</span> on the same axes. How is the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y_2\)</span> different from the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y_1\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Next we'll find the correct scale by trying functions of the form <span class="process-math">\(y = a(x - 2)e^{-(x-2)/b}\text{.}\)</span> Experiment with different whole number values of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> How do the values of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> affect the curve?</p></li>
<li><p>Graph <span class="process-math">\(y = 5(x - 2)e^{-(x-2)/4}\)</span> in the window <span class="process-math">\(\text{Xmin} = -5\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\text{Xmax} = 25\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\text{Ymin} = -20\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\text{Ymax} = 25\text{.}\)</span> This function is a reasonable approximation for the curve in the figure. Compare the area of decreased yield (below the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis) with the area of increased yield (above the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis). Which area is larger? Is the overall effect of hedgerows on crop yield good or bad?</p></li>
<li><p>About how far from the hedgerow do the beneficial effects extend? If the average hedgerow is about <span class="process-math">\(2.5\)</span> meters tall, how large should the field be to exploit their advantages?</p></li>
