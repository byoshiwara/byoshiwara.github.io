<p>Marlene is driving to a new outlet mall on Highway 17. There is a gas station at Marlene's on-ramp, where she buys gas and resets her odometer to zero before getting on the highway. The mall is only 15 miles from Marlene’s on-ramp, but she mistakenly drives past the mall and continues down the highway. Marlene's distance from the mall is a function of how far she has driven on Highway 17. See <a knowl="./knowl/fig-Marlene-highway.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-Marlene-highway" alt="Figure 2.124 " title="Figure 2.124 ">Figure 2.124</a>.</p>

<li>Make a table of values showing how far Marlene has driven on Highway 17 and how far she is from the mall.</li>
<li>Make a graph of Marlene’s distance from the mall versus the number of miles she has driven on the highway. Which of the basic graphs from Section 2.2 does your graph most resemble?</li>
<li>Find a piecewise defined formula that describes Marlene’s distance from the mall as a function of the distance she has driven on the highway.</li>
