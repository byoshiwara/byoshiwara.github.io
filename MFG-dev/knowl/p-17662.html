<p>The Explorer's Club is planning a canoe trip to travel <span class="process-math">\(90\)</span> miles up the Lazy River and return in <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> days. Club members plan to paddle for <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> hours each day, and they know that the current in the Lazy River is <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> miles per hour.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Express the time it will take for the upstream journey as a function of their paddling speed in still water.</p></li>
<li><p>Express the time it will take for the downstream journey as a function of their paddling speed in still water.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the sum of the two functions and find the point on the graph with <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-coordinate <span class="process-math">\(24\text{.}\)</span> Interpret the coordinates of the point in the context of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The Explorer's Club would like to know what average paddling speed members must maintain in order to complete their trip in <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> days. Write an equation to describe this situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve your equation to find the required paddling speed.</p></li>
