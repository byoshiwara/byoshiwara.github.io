<p>Ace, Inc. produces three kinds of wooden rackets: tennis rackets, Ping-Pong paddles, and squash rackets. After the pieces are cut, each racket goes through three phases of production: gluing, sanding, and finishing. A tennis racket takes \(3\) hours to glue, \(2\) hours to sand, and \(3\) hours to finish. A Ping-Pong paddle takes \(1\) hour to glue, \(1\) hour to sand, and \(1\) hour to finish. A squash racket takes \(2\) hours to glue, \(2\) hours to sand, and \(2\frac{1}{2} \) hours to finish. Ace has available \(95\) labor-hours in its gluing department, \(75\) labor-hours in sanding, and \(100\) labor-hours in finishing per day. How many of each racket should it make in order to use all the available personnel?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Systems-of-Linear-Equations-in-Three-Variables.html#exercise-3128">in-context</a></span>
