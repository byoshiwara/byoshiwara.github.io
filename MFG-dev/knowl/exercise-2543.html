<p>How far can you throw a baseball? The distance depends on the initial speed of the ball, <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and on the angle at which you throw it. For maximum range, you should throw the ball at <span class="process-math">\(45\degree\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>If there were no air resistance, the height, <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> of the ball t seconds after its release would be given in meters by the function</p>

<li><p>The fastest baseball pitch on record was <span class="process-math">\(45\)</span> meters per second, or about <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> miles per hour. Use your formula from part (b) to calculate the theoretical range of such a pitch. The value of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(9.8\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The maximum distance a baseball has actually been thrown is <span class="process-math">\(136\)</span> meters. Can you explain the discrepancy between this figure and your answer to part (c)?</p></li>
