<div class="introduction"><p>The quoted material in Problems 47–50  is taken from the article "Quantum Black Holes," by Bernard J. Carr and Steven B. Giddings, in the May 2005 issue of <span class="booktitle">Scientific American</span>.

<p>“The density to which matter must be squeezed [to create a black hole] scales as the inverse square of the mass. For a hole with the mass of the Sun, the density is about <span class="process-math">\(10^9\)</span> kilograms per cubic meter, higher than that of an atomic nucleus.”</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Recall that the density of an object is its mass per unit volume. Given that the mass of the sun is about <span class="process-math">\(2\times 10^{30}\)</span> kilograms, write a formula for the density, <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> of a black hole as a function of its mass, <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>“The known laws of physics allow for a matter density up to the so-called Planck value of <span class="process-math">\(10^{97}\)</span> kilograms per cubic meter.” If a black hole with this density could be created, it would be the smallest possible black hole. What would its mass be?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that a black hole is spherical, what would be the radius of the smallest possible black hole?</p></li>

<p>“A black hole radiates thermally, like a hot coal, with a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. For a solar-mass black hole, the temperature is around a millionth of a kelvin.”</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>The solar mass is given in Problem 47. Write a formula for the temperature, <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> of a black hole as a function of its mass, <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>What is the temperature of a black hole of mass <span class="process-math">\(10^{12}\)</span> kilograms, about the mass of a mountain?</p></li>

<p>“The total time for a black hole to evaporate away is proportional to the cube of its initial mass. For a solar-mass hole, the lifetime is an unobservably long <span class="process-math">\(10^{64}\)</span> years.”</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>The solar mass is given in Problem 47. Write a formula for the lifetime, <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> of a black hole as a function of its mass, <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The present age of the universe is about <span class="process-math">\(10^{10}\)</span> years. What would be the mass of a black hole as old as the universe?</p></li>

<p>“String theory <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span> predicts that space has dimensions beyond the usual three. In three dimensions, the force of gravity quadruples as you halve the distance between two objects. But in nine dimensions, gravity would get <span class="process-math">\(256\)</span> times as strong.”  In three dimensions, the force of gravity varies inversely with the square of distance. Write a formula for the force of gravity in nine dimensions.</p></article>
