<p>Carbon-14 occurs in living organisms with a fixed ratio to nonradioactive carbon-12. After a plant or animal dies, the carbon-14 decays into stable carbon with a halflife of \(5730\) years. When samples from the Shroud of Turin were analyzed in 1988, they were found to have \(91.2\%\) of their original carbon-14. How old were those samples in 1988?</p>
