<p>Charles's law says that the temperature of a gas is related to its volume by a linear equation. A gas that occupied one liter at <span class="process-math">\(0\degree\)</span>C expanded to <span class="process-math">\(1.2\)</span> liters at a temperature of <span class="process-math">\(54.6\degree\)</span>C. A second sample of gas that occupied <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> liters at <span class="process-math">\(0\degree\)</span>C expanded to <span class="process-math">\(2.8\)</span> liters at <span class="process-math">\(109.2\degree\)</span>C.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find a linear equation for temperature, <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> in terms of volume, <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> for the first sample of gas, and a second linear equation for the second sample of gas.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the system of equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the system. What is the significance of the intersection point?</p></li>
<li><p>Show that both equations from part (a) can be written in the form <span class="process-math">\(T = c\left(\dfrac{V}{V_0}-1 \right)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(V_0\)</span> is the volume of the gas at <span class="process-math">\(0\degree\)</span>C.</p></li>
