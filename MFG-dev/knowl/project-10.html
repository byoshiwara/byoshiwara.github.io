</h3>
<p>Halley's comet which orbits the sun every <span class="process-math">\(76\)</span> years, was first observed in 240 B.C. Its orbit is highly elliptical, so that its closest approach to the Sun (<dfn class="terminology">perihelion</dfn>) is only <span class="process-math">\(0.587\)</span> AU, while at its greatest distance (<dfn class="terminology">aphelion</dfn>) the comet is <span class="process-math">\(34.39\)</span> AU from the Sun. (An AU, or astronomical unit, is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, <span class="process-math">\(1.5\times 10^8\)</span> kilometers.)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Calculate the distances in meters from the Sun to Halley's comet at perihelion and aphelion.</p></li>
<li><p>Halley's comet has a volume of <span class="process-math">\(700\)</span> cubic kilometers, and its density is about <span class="process-math">\(0.1\)</span> gram per cubic centimeter. Calculate the mass of the comet in kilograms.</p></li>
<li><p>The gravitational force (in newtons) exerted by the Sun on its satellites is inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the satellite in meters. The constant of variation is <span class="process-math">\(Gm_1 m_2\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(m_1 = 1.99\times 10^{30}\)</span> kilograms is the mass of the Sun, <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> is the mass of the satellite, and <span class="process-math">\(G = 6.67\times 10^{-11}\)</span> is the gravitational constant. Write a formula for the force, <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> exerted by the sun on Halley's comet at a distance of <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> meters.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the force exerted by the sun on Halley's comet at perihelion and at aphelion.</p></li>
