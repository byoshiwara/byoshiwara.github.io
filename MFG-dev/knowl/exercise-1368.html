<p>The incubation time for a bird's egg is a function of the mass, <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> of the egg, and has been experimentally determined as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
I(m) = 12.0m^{0.217}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is measured in grams and <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is in days. (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Calculate the incubation time (to the nearest day) for the wren, whose eggs weigh about <span class="process-math">\(2.5\)</span> grams, and the greylag goose, whose eggs weigh <span class="process-math">\(46\)</span> grams.</p></li>
<li>
<p>During incubation, birds' eggs lose water vapor through their porous shells. The rate of water loss from the egg is also a function of its mass, and it appears to follow the rule</p>

<li><p>Explain why your result shows that most eggs lose about <span class="process-math">\(18\%\)</span> of their mass during incubation.</p></li>
