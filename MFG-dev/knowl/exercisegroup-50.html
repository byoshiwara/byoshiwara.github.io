<p>The temperature of an automobile engine is <span class="process-math">\(9\degree\)</span> Celsius when the engine is started and <span class="process-math">\(51\degree\)</span>C seven minutes later. Use a linear model to predict the engine temperature for both <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> minutes and <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> hours after it started. Are your predictions reasonable?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">34<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>The temperature in Death Valley is <span class="process-math">\(95\degree\)</span> Fahrenheit at 5 a.m. and rises to <span class="process-math">\(110\degree\)</span> Fahrenheit by noon. Use a linear model to predict the temperature at 2 p.m. and at midnight.

<p>The elephant at the City Zoo becomes ill and loses weight. She weighed <span class="process-math">\(10,012\)</span> pounds when healthy and only <span class="process-math">\(9641\)</span> pounds a week later.
