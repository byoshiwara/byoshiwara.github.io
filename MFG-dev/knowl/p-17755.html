<p>A person will float in fresh water if his or her density is less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> kilogram per liter, the density of water. (Density is given by the formula <span class="process-math">\(\text{density} = \dfrac{\text{weight}}{\text{volume}}\text{.}\)</span>) Suppose a swimmer weighs <span class="process-math">\(50 + F\)</span> kilograms, where <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is the amount of fat her body contains. (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Calculate the volume of her nonfat body mass if its density is <span class="process-math">\(1.1\)</span> kilograms per liter.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the volume of the fat if its density is <span class="process-math">\(0.901\)</span> kilograms per liter.</p></li>
<li><p>The swimmerâ€™s lungs hold <span class="process-math">\(2.6\)</span> liters of air. Write an expression for the total volume of her body, including the air in her lungs.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an expression for the density of the swimmer's body.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an equation for the amount of fat needed for the swimmer to float in fresh water.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve your equation. What percent of the swimmer's weight is fat?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose the swimmer's lungs can hold <span class="process-math">\(4.6\)</span> liters of air. What percent body fat does she need to be buoyant?</p></li>
