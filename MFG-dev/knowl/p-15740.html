<li><p>Fixed costs are given by <span class="process-math">\(C(0) = 250\text{,}\)</span> or $<span class="process-math">\(250\text{.}\)</span> The fixed costs include expenses like utility bills that must be paid even if no magazines are produced.</p></li>

<p>The graph is shown in figure (a). It is increasing from a vertical intercept of <span class="process-math">\(250\text{.}\)</span> The graph is concave down for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 8\)</span> approximately, and concave up for <span class="process-math">\(x\gt 8\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p>We must solve the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x^3 - 24x^2 + 195x + 250 = 1200
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We will solve the equation graphically, as shown in figure (b). Graph <span class="process-math">\(y = 1200\)</span> along with the cost function, and use the <em class="emphasis">intersect</em> command to find the intersection point of the graphs, <span class="process-math">\((15.319, 1200)\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C(x) = 1200\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is about <span class="process-math">\(15.319\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(15,319\)</span> copies can be printed for $<span class="process-math">\(1200\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>Although the cost is always increasing, it increases very slowly from about <span class="process-math">\(x = 5\)</span> to about <span class="process-math">\(x = 11\text{.}\)</span> The flattening of the graph in this interval is a result of economy of scale: By buying supplies in bulk and using time efficiently, the cost per magazine can be minimized. However, if the production level is too large, costs begin to rise rapidly again.</p></li>
