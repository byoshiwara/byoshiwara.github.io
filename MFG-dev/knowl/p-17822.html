<div class="para">The two equations are actually different forms of the same equation. Because they are equivalent, they share the same line as a graph, as shown at right. Every point on the first line is also a point on the second line, so every solution to the first equation is also a solution of the second equation. Thus, the system has infinitely many solutions.</div>
