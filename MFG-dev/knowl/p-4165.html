<p>Romina's Bakery has just signed contracts to provide baked goods for three new restaurants located on Route 28 outside of town. The Coffee Stop is \(2\) miles north of town center, Sneaky Pete's is \(8\) miles north, and the Sea Shell is \(12\) miles south. Romina wants to open a branch bakery on Route 28 to handle the new business. Where should she locate the bakery in order to minimize the distance she must drive for deliveries?</p>
