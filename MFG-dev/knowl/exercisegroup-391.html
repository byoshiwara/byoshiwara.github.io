<p>Property taxes on a house vary directly with the value of the house. If the taxes on a house worth $\(120,000\) are $\(2700\text{,}\) what would the taxes be on a house assessed at $\(275,000\text{?}\)</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>The cost of electricity varies directly with the number of units (BTUs) consumed. If a typical household in the Midwest uses \(83\) million BTUs of electricity annually and pays $\(1236\text{,}\) how much will a household that uses \(70\) million BTUs annually spend for energy?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>Distances on a map vary directly with actual distances. The scale on a map of Michigan uses \(\frac{3}{8} \) inch to represent \(10\) miles. If Isle Royale is \(1\frac{11}{16} \) inches long on the map, what is the actual length of the island?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>The dimensions of an enlargement vary directly with the dimensions of the original. A photographer plans to enlarge a photograph that measures \(8.3\) centimeters by \(11.2\) centimeters to produce a poster that is \(36\) centimeters wide. How long will the poster be?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>The Forest Service tags \(200\) perch and releases them into Spirit Lake. One month later, it captures \(80\) perch and finds that \(18\) of them are tagged. What is the Forest Service's estimate of the original perch population of the lake?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>The Wildlife Commission tags \(30\) Canada geese at one of its migratory feeding grounds. When the geese return, the commission captures \(45\) geese, of which \(4\) are tagged. What is the commission's estimate of the number of geese that use the feeding ground?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>The highest point on Earth is Mount Everest in Tibet, with an elevation of \(8848\) meters. The deepest part of the ocean is the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, near Indonesia, \(11,034\) meters below sea level.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What is the total height variation in the surface of the Earth?</p></li>
<li><p>What percentage of the Earth's radius, \(6400\) kilometers, is this variation?</p></li>
<li><p>If the Earth were shrunk to the size of a basketball, with a radius of \(4.75\) inches, what would be the corresponding height of Mount Everest?</p></li>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of human beings at the Hawaiian islands around 400 A.D., many species of birds became extinct. Fossils of \(29\) different species have been found, but some species may have left no fossils for us to find. We can estimate the total number of extinct species using a proportion. Of \(9\) species that are still alive, biologists have found fossil evidence of \(7\text{.}\) (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Assuming that the same fraction of extinct species have left fossil records, calculate the total number of extinct species</p></li>
<li><p>Give two reasons why this estimate may not be completely accurate.</p></li>
