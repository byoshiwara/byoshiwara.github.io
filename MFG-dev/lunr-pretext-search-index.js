  "body": " Modeling, Functions, and Graphs covers the content of a typical college algebra course with an emphasis on functions and modeling; when combined with a trigonometry text or supplement, this text can be used in a precalculus course.  Mathematics, as we all know, is the language of science, and fluency in algebraic skills has always been necessary for anyone aspiring to disciplines based on calculus. But in the information age, increasingly sophisticated mathematical methods are used in all fields of knowledge, from archaeology to zoology. Consequently, there is a new focus on the courses before calculus. The availability of calculators and computers allows students to tackle complex problems involving real data, but requires more attention to analysis and interpretation of results. All students, not just those headed for science and engineering, should develop a mathematical viewpoint, including critical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and estimation, in addition to computational skills.  The text employs a variety of applications to motivate mathematical thinking. Each chapter opens with a problem of historical or contemporary significance highlighting the material in the chapter, and includes by an Investigation that previews the skills to be introduced. These Investigations can be used in class as guided explorations or as projects for small groups. We have also provided a set of more challenging Projects at the end of each chapter.  Function notation is introduced in Chapter 1 and is used consistently in subsequent chapters treating the various families of functions. We study functions using algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal methods, and work to establish the connections between these approaches. We want students to learn to write an algebraic expression from a verbal description, recognize trends in a table of data, and extract and interpret information from the graph of a function. Many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more global view. By taking advantage of graphing utilities, we can examine a large number of examples and study them in detail, and we can consider more realistic models.  An in-text Exercise or \"Checkpoint,\" with answers, follows each Example, allowing students to try out new concepts and skills as they are presented. Each Section Summary includes a list of new Vocabulary words that can be found in the Glossary, a brief review of new Concepts introduced in the section, a short set of Study Questions for students to test their understanding of the material, and a list of mastery Skills and the appropriate Homework Problems for practicing each skill.  The text frequently refers students to the appropriate section of Appendix A, Algebra Skills Refresher. In addition, we have pepared an \"Algebra Toolkit\" that targets just the skills needed for each section of the text. We hope that these supplements will be useful both to individual students and to instructors who want to provide \"just-in-time\" parallel support for their classes.  An Activities Workbook is available from xyztextbooks. The Workbook provides a Lesson for each section in the book, consisting of Activities for students to complete in groups or with guidance from the instructor; or they can be used as support for a lecture format. Each Lesson ends with a Wrap-Up and a set of questions for discussion.  An Instructor's Manual for the text is also available. The Manual contains objectives and teaching notes for each section of the text, as well as suggested concept questions and topics for writing or discussion. The teaching notes include suggestions for using the Activities booklet and how to structure class time.  A computer homework system for the text is also available through xyzhomework.  We would like to thank Roy Simpson and his colleagues at Cosumnes River College, especially Min Zeng and Phuong Le, for their careful reading of the text and superior error-spotting skills. We also thank Tom Judson and the faculty at Stephen F. Austin State University for their help designing WeBWorK exercises for the text.   Katherine Yoshiwara  Atascadero, CA 2020  "

  "body": "Linear Models  Sales on Commission   Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment. He will be paid $1000 per month plus a 6% commission on his sales. The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about $8000 worth of equipment per month. To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations.   Based on the sales manager’s estimate, what monthly income can Delbert expect from this job? What annual salary would that provide?  What would Delbert’s monthly salary be if he sold only $5000 of equipment per month? What would his salary be if he sold $10,000 worth per month? Compute monthly incomes for each sales total shown in the table.

Income    Test your formula from part (5) to see if it gives the same results as those you recorded in the table.  Use your formula to find out what monthly sales total Delbert would need in order to have a monthly income of $2500.  Each increase of $1000 in monthly sales increases Delbert’s monthly income by .  Summarize the results of your work: In your own words, describe the relationship between Delbert’s monthly sales and his monthly income. Include in your discussion a description of your graph.    Tables, Graphs and Equations  The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between variables. In , we analyzed the relationship between Delbert's sales and his income. Starting from a verbal description, we represented the relationship in three different ways.   A table of values table of values displays specific data points with precise numerical values.  A graph graph is a visual display of the data. It is easier to spot trends and describe the overall behavior of the variables from a graph.  An algebraic equation algebraic equation is a compact summary of the model. It can be used to analyze the model and to make predictions   We begin our study of modeling with some examples of linear models linear models . In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools, and how each contributes to the model.  Annelise is on vacation at a seaside resort. She can rent a bicycle from her hotel for $3 an hour, plus a $5 insurance fee. (A fraction of an hour is charged as the same fraction of $3.)  Make a table of values showing the cost, , of renting a bike for various lengths of time, .  Plot the points on a graph. Draw a curve through the data points.  Write an equation for in terms of .   To find the cost, we multiply the time by $3, and add the result to the $5 insurance fee. For example, the cost of a 1-hour bike ride is A 1-hour bike ride costs $8. We record the results in a table, as shown here:     Length of rental (hours)  Cost of rental (dollars)                    Each pair of values represents a point on the graph. The first value gives the horizontal coordinate of the point, and the second value gives the vertical coordinate. The points lie on a straight line, as shown in the figure. The line extends infinitely in only one direction, because negative values of do not make sense here.  graph  To write an equation, we let represent the cost of the rental, and we use for the number of hours:     QuickCheck 1   When you graph the data given in a table, on which axis do you show the variable in the first row of the table?    The linear axis    The horizontal axis    The vertical axis    Both axes          The horizontal axis        Use the equation you found in to answer the following questions. Then show how to find the answers by using the graph.   How much will it cost Annelise to rent a bicycle for 6 hours?  How long can Annelise bicycle for $18.50?    We substitute into the expression for to find A 6-hour bike ride will cost $23. The point on the graph in the figure represents the cost of a 6-hour bike ride. The value on the -axis at the same height as point is 23, so a 6-hour bike ride costs $23.  We substitute into the equation and solve for . For $18.50 Annelise can bicycle for 4½ hours. The point on the graph represents an $18.50 bike ride. The value on the -axis below point is 4.5, so $18.50 will buy a 4.5 hour bike ride.  line though points    In , notice the different algebraic techniques we used in parts (a) and (b).

The graph below illustrates the answers.   graph of seedlings height vs time    Pause and Reflect   What is the difference between an expression and an equation?        Choosing Scales for the Axes  To create a useful graph, we must choose appropriate scales for the axes.  The axes must extend far enough to show the values of the variables.  The tick marks should be equally spaced.  Usually we should use no more than 10 or 15 tick marks.   In 1990, the median price of a home in the US was $92,000. The median price increased by about $4700 per year over the next decade.  Make a table of values showing the median price of a house in 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2000.  Choose suitable scales for the axes and plot the values you found in part (a) on a graph. Use , the number of years since 1990, on the horizontal axis and the price of the house, , on the vertical axis. Draw a curve through the points.  Write an equation that expresses in terms of .  How much did the price of the house increase from 1990 to 1996? Illustrate the increase on your graph.    In 1990 the median price was $92,000. Four years later, in 1994, the price had increased by dollars, so In 1998 the price had increased by dollars, so You can verify the price of the house in 2000 by a similar calculation.    Year  Price of House)                    We let stand for the number of years since 1990, so that in 1990, in 1994, and so on. To choose scales for the axes, we look at the values in the table. For this graph we scale the horizontal axis, or -axis, in 1-year intervals and the vertical axis, or -axis, for $90,000 to $140,000 in intervals of $5,000. The points lie on a straight line, as shown in the figure.  grid  Look back at the calculations in part (a). The price of the house started at $92,000 in 1990 and increased by dollars after years. Thus,  We find the points on the graph for 1990 and 1996. These points lie above and on the -axis. Next we find the values on the -axis corresponding to the two points. The values are in 1990 and in 1996. The increase in price is the difference of the two -values. The price of the home increased $28,200 between 1990 and 1996. This increase is indicated by the arrows in the figure.   QuickCheck 2   If is expressed in terms of which variable goes on the horizontal axis?

Practice 3   Silver Lake has been polluted by industrial waste products. The concentration of toxic chemicals in the water is currently 285 parts per million (ppm). Environmental officials would like to reduce the concentration by 15 ppm each year.    Complete the table of values showing the desired concentration, of toxic chemicals years from now. For each -value, calculate the corresponding value for Write your answers as ordered pairs.                 (0, )       (5, )       (10, )       (15, )      To choose scales for the axes, notice that the value of starts at 285 and decreases from there. We ll scale the vertical axis up to 300, and use 10 tick marks at intervals of 30. Graph the ordered pairs on the grid, and connect them with a straight line.    Write an equation for the concentration, of toxic chemicals years from now.  Equation:     For part (c): The concentration is initially 285 ppm, and we subtract 15 ppm for each year that passes, or                                                  The graph is shown below.

The grid lines on the -axis are not evenly spaced.    The scale on the -axis does not start at 0.    The axes are not labeled with the variables.    All of the above.               Linear Equations  All the models in the preceding examples have equations with a similar form: (We'll talk more about rate of change in .) Their graphs were all portions of straight lines. For this reason such equations are called linear equations linear equations . The order of the terms in the equation does not matter. For example, the equation in , can be written equivalently as and the equation in , can be written as This form of a linear equation, , is called the general form general form .  General Form for a Linear Equation  The graph of any equation where and are not both equal to zero, is a straight line.  The manager at Albert's Appliances has $3000 to spend on advertising for the next fiscal quarter. A 30-second spot on television costs $150 per broadcast, and a 30-second radio ad costs $50.  The manager decides to buy television ads and radio ads. Write an equation relating and .  Make a table of values showing several choices for and .  Plot the points from your table, and graph the equation.    Each television ad costs $150, so ads will cost $ . Similarly, radio ads will cost $ . The manager has $3000 to spend, so the sum of the costs must be $3000. Thus,  We choose some values of , and solve the equation for the corresponding value of . For example, if then If the manager buys 10 television ads, she can also buy 30 radio ads. You can verify the other entries in the table.                We plot the points from the table. All the solutions lie on a straight line, as shown in the figure.  grid   Practice 5   In central Nebraska, each acre of corn requires 25 acre-inches of water per year, and each acre of winter wheat requires 18 acre-inches of water.

To find the -intercept, set equal to zero and solve for .   The -intercept is the point , or simply .  The -intercept represents the concentration of toxic chemicals in Silver Lake now: When , , so the concentration is currently ppm.  The -intercept represents the number of years it will take for the concentration of toxic chemicals to drop to zero: When , , so it will take years for the pollution to be eliminated entirely.

Intercept Method for Graphing Lines  Because we really only need two points to graph a linear equation, we might as well find the intercepts first and use them to draw the graph. The values of the intercepts will also help us choose suitable scales for the axes. It is always a good idea to find a third point as a check.   Find the - and -intercepts of the graph of .

Finally, we find another point and check that it lies on this line. We choose and solve for . We plot the point . Because this point lies on the line, we can be reasonably confident that our graph is correct.  grid   QuickCheck 7   Is it possible for the -intercept and the -intercept of a line to be the same point?

  "body": "Functions  Definition of Function  We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For example, when a physician prescribes a drug in a certain dosage, she needs to know how long the dose will remain in the bloodstream. A sales manager needs to know how the price of his product will affect its sales. A function function is a special type of relationship between variables that allows us to make such predictions.  Suppose it costs $800 for flying lessons, plus $30 per hour to rent a plane. If we let represent the total cost for hours of flying lessons, then Thus, for example       when  ,    when  ,    when  ,    The variable is called the input input or independent independent variable, and is the output output or dependent dependent variable, because its values are determined by the value of . We can display the relationship between two variables by a table or by ordered pairs. The input variable is the first component of the ordered pair, and the output variable is the second component.                    For this relationship, we can find the value of for any given value of . All we have to do is substitute the value of into the equation and solve for . Note that there can be only one value of for each value of .  Definition of Function  A function function is a relationship between two variables for which a unique value of the output output variable can be determined from a value of the input input variable.   What distinguishes functions from other variable relationships? The definition of a function calls for a unique value —that is, exactly one value of the output variable corresponding to each value of the input variable. This property makes functions useful in applications because they can often be used to make predictions.   The distance, , traveled by a car in 2 hours is a function of its speed, . If we know the speed of the car, we can determine the distance it travels by the formula .  The cost of a fill-up with unleaded gasoline is a function of the number of gallons purchased. The gas pump represents the function by displaying the corresponding values of the input variable (number of gallons) and the output variable (cost).  Score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is not a function of score on an IQ test, because two people with the same score on an IQ test may score differently on the SAT; that is, a person’s score on the SAT is not uniquely determined by his or her score on an IQ test.  Practice 1     As part of a project to improve the success rate of freshmen, the counseling department studied the grades earned by a group of students in English and algebra. Do you think that a student s grade in algebra is a function of his or her grade in English?   Yes    No    Explain why or why not.    A) Each value of has exactly one value of associated with it.    B) Two students with the same grade English can have different grades in algebra.    C) Two students with the same grade math will also have the same grade in English.    D) Two students with the same grade math can have different grades in English.      Phatburger features a soda bar, where you can serve your own soft drinks in any size. Do you think that the number of calories in a serving of Zap Kola is a function of the number of fluid ounces?   Yes    No    Explain why or why not.    A) The number of calories is proportional to the number of fluid ounces.    B) Two servings with the same calories will have different fluid ounces.    C) Two servings with the same flid ounces will have different calories.                             No, students with the same grade in English can have different grades in algebra.    Yes, the number of calories is proportional to the number of fluid ounces.         QuickCheck 1   What distinguishes a function from other variable relationships?    A) The variables are related by a formula.    B) The values of the input and output variables must be different.    C) There cannot be two output values for a single input value.    D) There cannot be two input values for a single output value.          There cannot be two output values for a single input value.       A function can be described in several different ways. In the following examples, we consider functions defined by tables, by graphs, and by equations.   Functions Defined by Tables  When we use a table to describe a function, the first variable in the table (the left column of a vertical table or the top row of a horizontal table) is the input variable, and the second variable is the output. We say that the output variable is a function of the input.   The table below shows data on sales compiled over several years by the accounting office for Eau Claire Auto Parts, a division of Major Motors. In this example, the year is the input variable, and total sales is the output. We say that total sales, , is a function of  .    Year  Total sales   2000  $612,000   2001  $663,000   2002  $692,000   2003  $749,000   2004  $904,000   The table below gives the cost of sending printed material by first-class mail starting July 10, 2022.      Weight in ounces  Postage    $0.60    $0.84    $1.08    $1.32    $1.56    $1.80    $2.04   If we know the weight of the article being shipped, we can find the postage from the table. For instance, a catalog weighing 4.5 ounces would require $1.56 in postage. In this example, is the input variable and is the output variable. We say that  is a function of  .  The table below records the age and cholesterol count for 20 patients tested in a hospital survey.    Age  Cholesterol count   Age  Cholesterol count   53  217      48  232   53  241   55  198   49  186   56  238         57  208   52  264   52  248   53  195   50  214   47  203   56  271   48  212   53  193   50  234   48  172   According to these data, cholesterol count is not a function of age, because several patients who are the same age have different cholesterol levels. For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a unique value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a person’s cholesterol count.   Note that several different inputs for a function can have the same output. For example, the inputs 4.5 and 4.25 in part (b) of the Example above have output $1.31. However, a single input cannot have more than one output, as illustrated in part (c) of the Example.  Practice 2 Decide whether each table describes as a function of . Explain your choice.                                        Is a function of    Yes    No      Each value of has exactly one value of associated with it.    For example, corresponds both to and also to                                      Is a function of    Yes    No      Each value of has exactly one value of associated with it.    For example, corresponds both to and also to                           No, for example, corresponds both to and also to    Yes, each value of has exactly one value of associated with it.         QuickCheck 2   How would you know if a table of values does not come from a function?    A) The output values are all the same.    B) The input values are not evely spaced.    C) Two different input values have the same output value.    D) Two different output values have the same input value.          Two different output values have the same input value.        Functions Defined by Graphs  We can also use a graph to define a function. The input variable is displayed on the horizontal axis, and the output variable on the vertical axis.   The graph shows the number of hours, , that the sun is above the horizon in Peoria, Illinois, on day , where on January 1.    Which variable is the input, and which is the output?  How many hours of sunlight are there in Peoria on day 150?  On which days are there 12 hours of sunlight?  What are the maximum and minimum values of , and when do these values occur?   Peoria sunlight hours    The input variable, , appears on the horizontal axis. The number of daylight hours, , is a function of the date. The output variable appears on the vertical axis.  The point on the curve where has , so Peoria gets about 14.1 hours of daylight when , which is at the end of May.  at the two points where (in late March) and (late September).  The maximum value of 14.4 hours occurs on the longest day of the year, when , about three weeks into June. The minimum of 9.6 hours occurs on the shortest day, when , about three weeks into December.   Practice 3 The graph shows the elevation in feet, , of the Los Angeles Marathon course at a distance miles into the race.

The relevant distances (to the nearest half-mile) separated by commas: miles    What are the maximum and minimum values of and when do these values occur?  The maximum elevation is feet which occurs at .    The runners pass by the Los Angeles Coliseum at about 4.2 miles into the race. What is the elevation there?  Approximately (within 5) feet                                     The input variable is and the output variable is    Approximately 210 feet    Approximately where     and    The maximum value of 300 feet occurs at the start, when The minimum of 85 feet occurs when    Approximately 165 feet          Functions Defined by Equations  illustrates a function defined by an equation.   As of 2020, One World Trade Center in New York City is the nation’s tallest building, at 1776 feet. If an algebra book is dropped from the top of One World Trade Center, its height above the ground after seconds is given by the equation Thus, after second the book’s height is After seconds its height is For this function, is the input variable and is the output variable. For any value of , a unique value of can be determined from the equation for . We say that  is a function of  .

From this table, we can check the heights we found in .   Tbl Setup  table  Now try making a table of values with and . Use the and arrow keys to scroll up and down the table.   Pause and Reflect   Write one question you still have about functions.        Function Notation  There is a convenient notation for discussing functions. First, we choose a letter, such as , , or (or , , or ), to name a particular function. (We can use any letter, but these are the most common choices.)  For instance, in , the height, , of a falling algebra book is a function of the elapsed time, . We might call this function . In other words, is the name of the relationship between the variables and . We write which means \" is a function of , and is the name of the function.\"  The new symbol , read \" of ,\" is another name for the height, . The parentheses in the symbol do not indicate multiplication. (It would not make sense to multiply the name of a function by a variable.) Think of the symbol as a single variable that represents the output value of the function.  With this new notation we may write or just instead of to describe the function.  Perhaps it seems complicated to introduce a new symbol for , but the notation is very useful for showing the correspondence between specific values of the variables and .   In , the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of One World Trade Center is given by the equation We see that    when     when     Using function notation, these relationships can be expressed more concisely as     and    which we read as \" of 1 equals 1760\" and \" of 2 equals 1712.\" The values for the input variable, , appear inside the parentheses, and the values for the output variable, , appear on the other side of the equation.  Remember that when we write , the symbol is just another name for the output variable.   Function Notation  Function Notation   QuickCheck 4   True or False.

DJIA  The values of the input variable, time, are displayed on the horizontal axis, and the values of the output variable, DJIA, are displayed on the vertical axis. There is no formula that gives the DJIA for a particular day; but it is still a function, defined by its graph. The value of is specified by the vertical coordinate of the point with the given -coordinate.    The coordinates of point on the DJIA graph are . What do the coordinates tell you about the function ?  If the DJIA was 1726 at noon on October 20, what can you say about the graph of ?     The coordinates of point tell us that , so the DJIA was 2412 at noon on October 15.  We can say that , so the point lies on the graph of . This point is labeled in the figure above.

To find , we look for the point with -coordinate . The point lies on the graph of , so . Similarly, the point lies on the graph, so .  We look for points on the graph with -coordinate . Because the points , , and lie on the graph, we know that , , and . Thus, the -values we want are , , and .  The highest point on the graph is , so the largest -value is . Thus, the maximum value of is , and it occurs when .  A graph is increasing if the -values get larger as we read from left to right.

It is not possible for the function to take on the same -value at two different -values.    The maximum value of may occur at two different -values.    The maximum value of the function is the largest -value that appears on the graph.    at the -intercept of .          The maximum value of may occur at two different -values.        Finding Coordinates with a Graphing Utility  We can use the TRACE feature to find the coordinates of points on a graph. For example, graph the equation in the window    Xmin   Xmax   Ymin   Ymax   GC trace  Press TRACE , and a “bug” begins flashing on the display. The coordinates of the bug appear at the bottom of the display, as shown in the figure. Use the left and right arrows to move the bug along the graph. You can check that the coordinates of the point do satisfy the equation .  The points identified by the Trace bug depend on the window settings. If we want to find the -coordinate for a particular -value, we enter the -coordinate of the desired point and press ENTER .   Constructing the Graph of a Function  Although some functions are defined by their graphs, we can also construct graphs for functions described by tables or equations. We make these graphs the same way we graph equations in two variables: by plotting points whose coordinates satisfy the equation.  Graph the function  We choose several convenient values for and evaluate the function to find the corresponding -values. For this function we cannot choose -values less than , because the square root of a negative number is not a real number.     The results are shown in the table.                     square root graph  Points on the graph have coordinates , so the vertical coordinate of each point is given by the value of . We plot the points and connect them with a smooth curve, as shown in the figure. Notice that no points on the graph have -coordinates less than .

For this function, we enter and press ZOOM  for the standard window. The graph is shown below.

The graph is shown below.      cubic  Pause and Reflect   How is graphing a function different from graphing an equation?        The Vertical Line Test  In a function, two different outputs cannot be related to the same input. This restriction means that two different ordered pairs cannot have the same first coordinate. What does it mean for the graph of the function?  Consider the graph shown in figure (a) below. Every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, so there is only one point on the graph for each -value. This graph represents a function.  vertical line test  In figure (b), however, the line intersects the graph at two points, and . Two different -values, and , are related to the same -value, . This graph cannot be the graph of a function.  We summarize these observations as follows.  The Vertical Line Test  A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.   Use the vertical line test to decide which of the graphs in the figure represent functions.  vertical line test   Graph (a) represents a function, because it passes the vertical line test.  Graph (b) is not the graph of a function, because the vertical line at (for example) intersects the graph at two points.  For graph (c), notice the break in the curve at : The solid dot at is the only point on the graph with ; the open circle at indicates that is not a point on the graph. Thus, graph (c) is a function, with .   QuickCheck 4   What does the vertical line test tell us?    A) If the graph is a vertical line.    B) If the graph is increasing.    C) If the graph is decreasing.    D) If the graph is a function.          The vertical line test tells us if the graph is a function.       Practice 4 Use the vertical line test to determine which of the graphs below represent functions.  vertical line test     (a)    (b)    (c)    None of the above          Only (b) is a function.        Graphical Solution of Equations and Inequalities  The graph of an equation in two variables is just a picture of its solutions. When we read the coordinates of a point on the graph, we are reading a pair of - and -values that make the equation true.   For example, the point lies on the graph of shown at right, so we know that the ordered pair is a solution of the equation . You can verify algebraically that and satisfy the equation:   function graph  We can also say that is a solution of the one-variable equation . In fact, we can use the graph of to solve the equation for any value of . Thus, we can use graphs to find solutions to equations in one variable.   Use the graph of to solve the equation .    We begin by locating the point on the graph for which , as shown in the figure.  Next we find the -coordinate of point by drawing an imaginary line from straight down to the -axis. The -coordinate of is .  Thus, is the point , and when . The solution of the equation is .  function graph  You can verify the solution algebraically by substituting into the equation:  Does ?    QuickCheck 5   If what point lies on the graph of          Both and    All points between 2 and 8.                The relationship between an equation and its graph is an important one. For the previous example, make sure you understand that the following three statements are equivalent:  The point lies on the graph of .  The ordered pair is a solution of the equation .  is a solution of the equation .   Practice 5  function graph      Use the graph of shown above to solve the equation      Verify your solution algebraically.            The point on the line where the -coordinate is 50 is the point so is the solution.    We verify that we have an identity when we substitute into the equation          For part (b):  We verify that we have an identity when we substitute into the equation .    In a similar fashion, we can solve inequalities with a graph.  Consider again the graph of , shown at right. We saw that is the solution of the equation . When we use as the input for the function , the output is . Which input values for produce output values greater than ?

You are probably familiar with the notion of comparison shopping. To decide which dish soap is the better buy, we compute the unit price, or price per ounce, for each bottle. The unit price for Velvolux is and the unit price for Rainfresh is  The Velvolux costs less per ounce, so it is the better buy. By computing the price of each brand for the same amount of soap , it is easy to compare them.  In many situations, a ratio, similar to a unit price, can provide a basis for comparison. uses a ratio to measure a rate of growth.   Which grow faster, Hybrid A wheat seedlings, which grow 11.2 centimeters in 14 days, or Hybrid B seedlings, which grow 13.5 centimeters in 18 days?  We compute the growth rate for each strain of wheat. Growth rate is expressed as a ratio, , or centimeters per day. The growth rate for Hybrid A is and the growth rate for Hybrid B is Because their rate of growth is larger, the Hybrid A seedlings grow faster.  By computing the growth of each strain of wheat seedling over the same unit of time, a single day, we have a basis for comparison. In this case, the ratio measures the rate of growth of the wheat seedlings.  Practice 1   Delbert traveled miles on gallons of gas, and Francine traveled miles on gallons of gas. Compute the ratio for each car.  Delbert:   Francine:   Whose car gets the better gas mileage?   Delbert    Francine                    Delbert: mpg, Francine: mpg. Francine gets better mileage.        QuickCheck 1   The weight of gallons of gasoline is pounds, and the weight of gallons of water is pounds. Compute the ratio for each liquid.  gasoline:   water:   Which liquid weighs more per gallon   gasoline    water                    gasoline: pounds per gallon, water: pounds per gallon. Water weighs more per gallon.       In , the ratio measures the rate at which each car uses gasoline. By computing the mileage for each car for the same amount of gas, we have a basis for comparison. We can use this same idea, finding a common basis for comparison, to measure the steepness of an incline.   Measuring Steepness  Imagine you are an ant carrying a heavy burden along one of the two paths shown below. Which path is more difficult? Most ants would agree that the steeper path is more difficult.  But what exactly is steepness? It is not merely the gain in altitude, because even a gentle incline will reach a great height eventually. Steepness measures how sharply the altitude increases. An ant finds the second path more difficult, or steeper, because it rises 5 feet while the first path rises only 2 feet over the same horizontal distance.  ant's climb  To compare the steepness of two inclined paths, we compute the ratio of change in altitude to change in horizontal distance for each path.  Which is steeper, Stony Point trail, which climbs 400 feet over a horizontal distance of 2500 feet, or Lone Pine trail, which climbs 360 feet over a horizontal distance of 1800 feet?  For each trail, we compute the ratio of vertical gain to horizontal distance. For Stony Point trail, the ratio is and for Lone Pine trail, the ratio is Lone Pine trail is steeper, because it has a vertical gain of 0.20 foot for every foot traveled horizontally. Or, in more practical units, Lone Pine trail rises 20 feet for every 100 feet of horizontal distance, whereas Stony Point trail rises only 16 feet over a horizontal distance of 100 feet.  Practice 2   Which is steeper, a staircase that rises feet over a horizontal distance of feet, or the steps in the football stadium, which rise yards over a horizontal distance of yards?  Answer:   staircase    steps in stadium          Staircase: Steps: The staircase is steeper.        Definition of Slope  To compare the steepness of the two trails in , it is not enough to know which trail has the greater gain in elevation overall. Instead, we compare their elevation gains over the same horizontal distance. Using the same horizontal distance provides a basis for comparison. The two trails are illustrated below as lines on a coordinate grid.  trails on grid  The ratio we computed in , appears on the graphs as For example, as we travel along the line representing Stony Point trail, we move from the point to the point . The -coordinate changes by and the -coordinate changes by , giving the ratio that we found in . We call this ratio the slope of the line.  Definition of Slope  The slope slope of a line is the ratio as we move from one point to another on the line.    Compute the slope of the line that passes through points and on the graph at right.  points on line  As we move along the line from to , the -coordinate changes by units, and the -coordinate changes by units. The slope of the line is thus   Practice 3  line on grid    Compute the slope of the line through the indicated points on the graph above. On both axes, one square represents one unit.               QuickCheck 3   What is wrong with the following reasoning? The point lies on the graph of a line, so the slope of the line is    The slope is .    7 is not an intercept.    We need two points to compute the slope.    The line is decreasing.          We need two points to compute the slope.       The slope of a line is a number . It tells us how much the -coordinates of points on the line increase when we increase their -coordinates by 1 unit. For instance, the slope in means that the -coordinate increases by unit when the -coordinate increases by 1 unit. For increasing graphs, a larger slope indicates a greater increase in altitude, and hence a steeper line.   Notation for Slope  We use a shorthand notation for the ratio that defines slope, The symbol (the Greek letter delta) is used in mathematics to denote change in . In particular, means change in -coordinate , and means change in -coordinate . We also use the letter to stand for slope. With these symbols, we can write the definition of slope as follows.  Notation for Slope  The slope slope of a line is given by  slope of line   The Great Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt was built around 2550 B.C. It is 147 meters tall and has a square base 229 meters on each side. Calculate the slope of the sides of the pyramid, rounded to two decimal places.  From the figure, we see that is only half the base of the Great Pyramid, so and the slope of the side is  Great Pyramid  Practice 4  The Kukulcan Pyramid at Chichen Itza in Mexico was built around 800 A.D. It is meters high, with a temple built on its top platform, as shown at right.  Kukulcan Pyramid    The square base is 55 meters on each side, and the top platform is 19.5 meters on each side. Calculate the slope of the sides of the pyramid. Which pyramid is steeper, Kukulcan or the Great Pyramid (whose slope, rounded to two decimals, is 1.28)?  Answer:   Kukulcan    Great Pyramid     The horizontal change is half the difference between the sides of the base and of the top platform.        The horizontal change is half the difference between the sides of the base and of the top platform: so the slope is which is greater than 1.28. Kukulcan is steeper.       So far, we have only considered examples in which and are positive numbers, but they can also be negative.   Compute the slope of the line that passes through the points and shown in at right. Illustrate and on the graph.  negative slope  As we move from the point to the point , we move units down , so .

Compare the meanings of the two statements and       We can move from point to point in either direction to compute the slope. The line graphed in  decreases as we move from left to right and hence has a negative slope.  The slope is the same if we move from point to point instead of from to , as shown at right. In that case, our computation looks like this:  and are labeled on the graph.  negative slope   Lines Have Constant Slope  How do we know which two points to choose when we want to compute the slope of a line? It turns out that any two points on the line will do.  Practice 5     Graph the line by finding the - and -intercepts  -intercept:  -intercept:  Note: Enter each intercept as an ordered pair.    Compute the slope of the line using the -intercept and -intercept.

The -intercept is and the -intercept is  The slope is    The slope is        The graph for part (a):  line  illustrates an important property of lines: They have constant slope. No matter which two points we use to calculate the slope, we will always get the same result. We will see later that lines are the only graphs that have this property.  We can think of the slope as a scale factor that tells us how many units increases (or decreases) for each unit of increase in . Compare the lines shown below.  slopes  QuickCheck 4   How can you tell from the equation of a line whether its graph is decreasing?    Its slope is positive.    Its -intercept is positive.    Its slope is negative.    Its -intercept is negative.          The graph is decreasing when its slope is negative.       Observe that a line with positive slope increases from left to right, and one with negative slope decreases. What sort of line has slope ?   Meaning of Slope  In , we graphed the equation showing the cost of a bicycle rental in terms of the length of the rental. The graph is reproduced at right. We can choose any two points on the line to compute its slope. Using points and as shown, we find that The slope of the line is .  meaning of slope  What does this value mean for the cost of renting a bicycle? The expression stands for  If we increase the length of the rental by 3 hours, the cost of the rental increases by 9 dollars. The slope gives the rate of increase in the rental fee, 3 dollars per hour. In general, we can make the following statement.  Rate of Change  The slope of a line measures the rate of change rate of change of the output variable with respect to the input variable.   Depending on the variables involved, this rate might be interpreted as a rate of growth or a rate of speed. A negative slope might represent a rate of decrease or a rate of consumption. The slope of a graph can give us valuable information about the variables.   The graph at right shows the distance in miles traveled by a big-rig truck driver after hours on the road.  Compute the slope of the graph.  What does the slope tell us about the problem?   truck   Choose any two points on the line, say and , as shown. As we move from to , we find The slope of the line is 50.  The best way to understand the slope is to include units in the calculation. For our example, or The slope represents the trucker’s average speed or velocity.   Practice 6  The graph shows the altitude, (in feet), of a skier minutes after getting on a ski lift.  ski lift graph      Choose two points and compute the slope (including units). (Note: Use ft for feet and use min for minutes.)     What does the slope tell us about the problem?    A) The steepness of the ski lift.    B) The increase in altitude per minute.    C) The time to rise a foot in altitude.    D) The cost of using the ski lift.                      The skier s altitude increases by feet per minute.         Pause and Reflect   How does slope measure rate of change?        A Formula for Slope  We have defined the slope of a line to be the ratio as we move from one point to another on the line. So far, we have computed and by counting squares on the graph, but this method is not always practical. All we really need are the coordinates of two points on the graph.  Subscripts  We will use subscripts subscripts to distinguish the two points: We denote the coordinates of by and the coordinates of by .  slope of line  Now consider a specific example. The line through the two points and is shown at left. We can find by subtracting the -coordinates of the points: In general, we have and similarly   These formulas work even if some of the coordinates are negative; in our example By counting squares down from to , we see that is indeed . The slope of the line is We now have a formula for the slope of a line that works even if we do not have a graph.  Two-Point Slope Formula  The slope of the line passing through the points and is given by  Compute the slope of the line above using the points and .  We substitute the coordinates of and into the slope formula to find This value for the slope, , is the same value we found above.

Thus, we can write the equation of a line as where the constant term, , is the -intercept of the line, and , the coefficient of , is the slope of the line. This form for the equation of a line is called the slope-intercept form slope-intercept form .  Slope-Intercept Form  If we write the equation of a linear function in the form, then is the slope slope of the line, and is the -intercept .   (You may have encountered the slope-intercept equation in the equivalent form .)  For example, consider the two linear functions and their graphs shown below.                         deceasing line                        inceasing line  Some observations:  We can see that the -intercept of each line is given by the constant term, .  By examining the table of values, we can also see why the coefficient of gives the slope of the line:  For , each time increases by unit, decreases by units.  For , each time increases by unit, increases by units.  For each graph, the coefficient of is a scale factor that tells us how many units changes for unit increase in . But that is exactly what the slope tells us about a line.   Francine is choosing an Internet service provider. She paid $30 for a modem, and she is considering three companies for service:  Juno charges $14.95 per month,  ISP.com charges $12.95 per month,  and peoplepc charges $15.95 per month.  Match the graphs in the figure to Francine’s Internet cost with each company.  internet provider costs  Francine pays the same initial amount, $30 for the modem, under each plan. The monthly fee is the rate of change of her total cost, in dollars per month. We can write a formula for her cost under each plan.   The graphs of these three functions all have the same -intercept, but their slopes are determined by the monthly fees. The steepest graph, III, is the one with the largest monthly fee, peoplepc, and ISP.com, which has the lowest monthly fee, has the least steep graph, I.

Slope-Intercept Method of Graphing  Look again at the lines in the previous figure: There is only one line that has a given slope and passes through a particular point. That is, the values of and determine the particular line. The value of gives us a starting point, and the value of tells us which direction to go to plot a second point. Thus, we can graph a line given in slope-intercept form without having to make a table of values.   Write the equation in slope-intercept form.  Graph the line by hand.    We solve the equation for in terms of .  We see that the slope of the line is and its -intercept is . We begin by plotting the -intercept, . We then use the slope to find another point on the line. We have so starting at , we move units in the -direction and units in the -direction, to arrive at the point . Finally, we draw the line through these two points.   slope-intercept method  The slope of a line is a ratio and can be written in many equivalent ways. In , the slope is equal to , , and . We can use any of these fractions to locate a third point on the line as a check. If we use , we move down units and left units from the -intercept to find the point on the line.  Slope-Intercept Method for Graphing a Line   Plot the -intercept .  Use the definition of slope to find a second point on the line: Starting at the -intercept, move units in the -direction and units in the -direction. Plot a second point at this location.  Use an equivalent form of the slope to find a third point, and draw a line through the points.   slope-intercept method  Practice 2     Write the equation in slope-intercept form.

Point-Slope Form  We can find the equation for a line if we know its slope and -intercept. What if we do not know the -intercept, but instead know some other point on the line? There is only one line that passes through a given point and has a given slope, so we should be able to find its equation.  For example, we can graph the line of slope that passes through the point . We first plot the given point, , as shown in the figure below.  Then we use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is so we move down units and then units to the right, starting from . This brings us to the point . We can then draw the line through these two points.  point slope  We can also find an equation for the line, as shown in .   Find an equation for the line that passes through and has slope .  We will use the formula for slope, We substitute for the slope, , and for . For the second point, , we use the variable point . Substituting these values into the slope formula gives us To solve for we first multiply both sides by . The equation of the line is   QuickCheck 3   What will be wrong with your answer if you accidentally compute the slope as    A) The number will be too big.    B) The line will be decreasing.    C) That is the slope of the perpendicular line.    D) It will have the wrong sign.          It will have the wrong sign.       When we use the slope formula in this way to find the equation of a line, we substitute a variable point for the second point. This version of the formula, is called the point-slope form point-slope form for a linear equation. It is sometimes stated in another form obtained by clearing the fraction to get  Point-Slope Form  The equation of the line that passes through the point and has slope is   Practice 4   Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the line that passes through the point and has slope                The point-slope form is useful for modeling linear functions when we don't know the initial value but do know some other point on the line.

  "body": "Linear Regression   We have spent most of this chapter analyzing models described by graphs or equations. To create a model, however, we often start with a quantity of data. Choosing an appropriate function for a model is a complicated process. In this section, we consider only linear models and explore methods for fitting a linear function to a collection of data points. First, we fit a line through two data points.  Fitting a Line through Two Points  If we already know that two variables are related by a linear function, we can find a formula from just two data points. For example, variables that increase or decrease at a constant rate can be described by linear functions.   In 1993, Americans drank 188.6 million cases of wine. Wine consumption increased at a constant rate over the next decade, and we drank 258.3 million cases of wine in 2003. (Source: Los Angeles Times, Adams Beverage Group)  Find a formula for wine consumption, , in millions of cases, as a linear function of time, , in years since 1990.  State the slope as a rate of change. What does the slope tell us about this problem?    We have two data points of the form , namely and . We use the point-slope formula to fit a line through these two points. First, we compute the slope. Next, we use the slope and either of the two data points in the point-slope formula. Thus, .  The slope gives us the rate of change of the function, and the units of the variables can help us interpret the slope in context. Over the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, wine consumption in the United States increased at a rate of 6.97 million cases per year.    To Fit a Line through Two Points:   Compute the slope between the two points.  Substitute the slope and either point into the point-slope formula   Practice 1   In 1991, there were 64.6 burglaries per 1000 households in the United States. The number of burglaries reported annually declined at a roughly constant rate over the next decade, and in 2001 there were 28.7 burglaries per 1000 households. (Source: U.S. Department of Justice)   Find a function for the number of burglaries, as a function of time, in years, since 1990.     State the slope as a rate of change.  is   burglaries per decade    burglaries per 1000 households per year    households per burglary per year    burglaries per year    What does the slope tell us about this problem?    A) The burglary rate declined by 3.59 burglaries per decade    B) The burglary rate declined by 3.59 burglaries per 1000 households every year    C) The burglary rate declined by 3.59 burglaries per year    (in the years 1991 to 2001).                           Because corresponds to 1990, we have the two points (1,64.6) and (11,28.7) to compute the slope Using the point-slope formula with either point and then simplifying, we find that    burglaries per 1000 households per year. From 1991 to 2001, the burglary rate declined by 3.59 burglaries per 1000 households every year.         QuickCheck 1   What are the two steps to find the equation of a line through two points?    Draw the line, use the point-slope formula    Compute the slope, find the -intercept    Compute the slope, use the point-slope formula    Find the intercepts, compute the slope          Compute the slope, use the point-slope formula        Scatterplots  Empirical data points in a linear relation may not lie exactly on a line. There are many factors that can affect experimental data, including measurement error, the influence of environmental conditions, and the presence of related variable quantities.   A consumer group wants to test the gas mileage of a new model SUV. They test-drive six vehicles under similar conditions and record the distance each drove on various amounts of gasoline.    Gasoline used (gal)         Miles driven          Are the data linear?  Draw a line that fits the data.  What does the slope of the line tell us about the data?    No, the data are not strictly linear. If we compute the slopes between successive data points, the values are not constant. We can see from an accurate plot of the data, shown below, that the points lie close to, but not precisely on, a straight line.  gas mileage  gas mileage  We would like to draw a line that comes as close as possible to all the data points, even though it may not pass precisely through any of them. In particular, we try to adjust the line so that we have the same number of data points above the line and below the line. One possible solution is shown above.  To compute the slope of the our estimated line, we first choose two points on the line. Our line appears to pass through one of the data points, . We look for a second point on the line whose coordinates are easy to read, perhaps . The slope is According to our data, the SUV gets about 17.2 miles to the gallon.   To find the slope of your estimated line, be sure to choose points on the line ; do not choose any of the data points (unless they happen to lie on your line).  Practice 2     Plot the data points. Do the points lie on a line?    Yes    No      Draw a line that fits the data.                                        No. A scatterplot is shown below.    See the graph below        Graphs for both parts (a) and (b):   scatterplot  scatterplot with regression line   The graph in is called a scatterplot scatterplot . The points on a scatterplot may or may not show some sort of pattern. Consider the three plots shown below.  In figure (a), the data points resemble a cloud of gnats; there is no apparent pattern to their locations.  In figure (b), the data follow a generally decreasing trend, but certainly do not all lie on the same line.  The points in figure (c) are even more organized; they seem to lie very close to an imaginary line.   three scatterplots  QuickCheck 2   Can two points on a scatterplot have the same -coordinate? Can two points have the same -coordinate?    Yes, Yes    Yes, No    No, Yes    No, No          Yes, Yes       If the data in a scatterplot are roughly linear, we can estimate the location of an imaginary line of best fit line of best fit that passes as close as possible to the data points. We can then use this line to make predictions about the data.   Linear Regression  One measure of a person's physical fitness is the body mass index body mass index , or BMI. Your BMI is the ratio of your weight in kilograms to the square of your height in centimeters. Thus, thinner people have lower BMI scores, and fatter people have higher scores. The Centers for Disease Control considers a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 to be healthy.  The points on the scatterplot below show the BMI of Miss America from 1921 to 1991. From the data in the scatterplot, can we see a trend in Americans’ ideal of female beauty?  Miss America BMI   Estimate a line of best fit for the scatterplot above. (Source: http:\/\/www.pbs.org)  Use your line to estimate the BMI of Miss America 1980.    We draw a line that fits the data points as best we can, as shown below. (Note that we have set in 1920 on this graph.) We try to end up with roughly equal numbers of data points above and below our line.  Miss America BMI  We see that when on this line, the -value is approximately 18.3. We therefore estimate that Miss America 1980 had a BMI of 18.3. (Her actual BMI was 17.85.)    QuickCheck 3   We can estimate a line of best fit by drawing the line that passes through:    The first and last data points    Two data points in the middle    Either of these    None of these          None of these       Practice 3  hominid brains    Human brains consume a large amount of energy, about 16 times as much as muscle tissue per unit weight. In fact, brain metabolism accounts for about 25% of an adult human s energy needs, as compared to about 5% for other mammals.    Draw a line of best fit through the data points.    Estimate the amount of energy used by the brain of a hominid species that lived three million years ago.  %            A graph is below.    About 10.5%        A graph for part (a): scatterplot with regression line  The process of predicting an output value based on a straight line that fits the data is called linear regression linear regression , and the line itself is called the regression line regression line . The equation of the regression line is usually used (instead of a graph) to predict values.   Find the equation of the regression line in .  Use the regression equation to predict the BMI of Miss America 1980.    We first calculate the slope by choosing two points on the regression line. The points we choose are not necessarily any of the original data points; instead they should be points on the regression line itself. The line appears to pass through the points and . The slope of the line is then Now we use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line. (If you need to review the point-slope formula, see .) We substitute and use either of the two points for ; we will choose . The equation of the regression line is  We will use the regression equation to make our prediction. For Miss America 1980, and This value agrees well with the estimate we made in .   QuickCheck 4   How many data points must a good regression line pass through?    Three    Two    One    None          None: the regression line does not need to pass through any of the data points.       Practice 4  manatee deaths    The number of manatees killed by watercraft in Florida waters has been increasing since 1975. Data are given at 5-year intervals in the table.

Use the regression equation to estimate the number of manatees killed by watercraft in 1998.  manatees                 A graph is below.       65         A graph for part (a) is below.  scatterplot with regression line   Pause and Reflect   Describe a strategy for sketching a line of best fit by eye.        Linear Interpolation and Extrapolation  Using a regression line to estimate values between known data points is called interpolation interpolation . Making predictions beyond the range of known data is called extrapolation extrapolation .   Use linear interpolation to estimate the BMI of Miss America 1960.  Use linear extrapolation to predict the BMI of Miss America 2001.    For 1960, we substitute into the regression equation we found in . We estimate that Miss America 1960 had a BMI of 19.08. (Her BMI was actually 18.79.)  For 2001, we substitute into the regression equation.  Our model predicts that Miss America 2001 had a BMI of 17.44. In fact, her BMI was 20.25. By the late 1990s, public concern over the self-image of young women had led to a reversal of the trend toward ever-thinner role models.   b illustrates an important fact about extrapolation: If we try to extrapolate too far, we may get unreasonable results. For example, if we use our model to predict the BMI of Miss America 2520 (when ), we get Even if the Miss America pageant is still operating in 600 years, the winner cannot have a negative BMI. Our linear model provides a fair approximation for 1920 1990, but if we try to extrapolate too far beyond the known data, the model may no longer apply.  We can also use interpolation and extrapolation to make estimates for nonlinear functions. Sometimes a variable relationship is not linear, but a portion of its graph can be approximated by a line.  Emily's height  The graph at right shows a child’s height each month. The graph is not linear because her rate of growth is not constant; her growth slows down as she approaches her adult height. However, over a short time interval the graph is close to a line, and that line can be used to approximate the coordinates of points on the curve.  QuickCheck 5   If you add more data points to the scatterplot, could the regression line change?    Yes    No    Only the slope could change.    Only the intercept could change.          Yes       Practice 5   Emily was 82 centimeters tall at age 36 months and 88 centimeters tall at age 48 months.   Find a linear equation that approximates Emily s height in terms of her age over the given time interval. Let be Emily s age in months.     Use linear interpolation to estimate Emily s height when she was 38 months old, and extrapolate to predict her height at age 50 months.  Age 38 months: cm  Age 50 months: cm    Predict Emily s height at age 25 (300 months).  Age 25 years: cm  Is your answer reasonable?   Yes    No                                     cm, cm    cm; No         Pause and Reflect   Explain the difference between interpolation and extrapolation.       Estimating a line of best fit is a subjective process. Rather than base their estimates on such a line, statisticians often use the least squares regression line least squares regression line .  least squares line  This regression line minimizes the sum of the squares of all the vertical distances between the data points and the corresponding points on the line, as shown at left. Many calculators are programmed to find the least squares regression line, using an algorithm that depends only on the data, not on the appearance of the graph.  Using Technology for Linear Regression  You can use a graphing calculator to make a scatterplot, find a regression line, and graph the regression line with the data points.

Astronomers use a numerical scale called magnitude to measure the brightness of a star, with brighter stars assigned smaller magnitudes. When we view a star from Earth, dust in the air absorbs some of the light, making the star appear fainter than it really is. Thus, the observed magnitude of a star, , depends on the distance its light rays must travel through the Earth's atmosphere. The observed magnitude is given by where is the actual magnitude of the star outside the atmosphere, is the air mass (a measure of the distance through the atmosphere), and is a constant called the extinction coefficient . To calculate , astronomers observe the same object several times during the night at different positions in the sky, and hence for different values of . Here are data from such observations.

For example, the formula for water, H 0, means that two atoms of hydrogen combine with one atom of oxygen to make one water molecule. Similarly, magnesium and oxygen combine to produce magnesium oxide. In this problem, we will discover the chemical formula for magnesium oxide.

To compute the slope of the our estimated line, we first choose two points on the line. Our line appears to pass through one of the data points, .

Linear models have equations of the following form:   The general form for a linear equation is .  We can use the intercepts to graph a line. The intercepts are also useful for interpreting a model.  A function is a rule that assigns to each value of the input variable a unique value of the output variable.  Function notation: , where is the input and is the output.  The point lies on the graph of the function if and only if .  Each point on the graph of the function has coordinates for some value of .  The vertical line test tells us whether a graph represents a function.  Lines have constant slope.  The slope of a line gives us the rate of change of one variable with respect to another.   Formulas for Linear Functions     The slope-intercept form is useful when we know the initial value and the rate of change.  The point-slope form is useful when we know the rate of change and one point on the line.  Linear functions form a two-parameter family , .  We can approximate a linear pattern by a regression line .  We can use interpolation or extrapolation to make estimates and predictions.  If we extrapolate too far beyond the known data, we may get unreasonable results.  .     Chapter 1 Review Problems  Write and graph a linear equation for each situation. Then answer the questions.

The rate at which air temperature decreases with altitude is called the lapse rate. In the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere that extends from the Earth’s surface to a height of about miles, the lapse rate is about F for every feet. (Source: Ahrens, 1998)  If the temperature on the ground is F, write an equation for the temperature, , at an altitude of feet.  What is the temperature outside an aircraft flying at an altitude of feet? How much colder is that than the ground temperature?  What is the temperature at the top of the troposphere?     F; F  F   In his television program Notes from a Small Island , aired in February 1999, Bill Bryson discussed the future of the British aristocracy. Because not all families produce an heir, 4 or 5 noble lines die out each year. At this rate, Mr. Bryson says, if no more peers are created, there will be no titled families left by the year 2175.  Assuming that on average titled families die out each year, write an equation for the number, , of noble houses left in year , where in the year 1999.  Graph your equation.  According to your graph, how many noble families existed in 1999? Which point on the graph corresponds to this information?   Find an equation for the line passing through the two given points.     For Problems 77 and 78,  Make a table of values showing two data points.  Find a linear equation relating the variables.  State the slope of the line, including units, and explain its meaning in the context of the problem.   The population of Maple Rapids was in 2005 and had grown to by 2020.

Cicely’s odometer read miles when she filled up her -gallon gas tank and when the gas gauge read half full. Express her odometer reading, , in terms of the amount of gas, , she used.   In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded because of O-ring failure on a morning when the temperature was about F. Previously, there had been one incident of O-ring failure when the temperature was F and three incidents when the temperature was F. Use linear extrapolation to estimate the number of incidents of O-ring failure you would expect when the temperature is F.  Thelma typed a -page technical report in minutes.

Is there an optimal clutch size for birds of a given species, or does it depend on the individual bird?  In 1980, biologists in Sweden conducted an experiment on magpies as follows: They reduced or enlarged the natural clutch size by adding or removing eggs from the nests. They then computed the average number of fledglings successfully raised by the parent birds in each case.  The graph shows the results for magpies that initially laid 5, 6, 7, or 8 eggs. (Source: Högstedt, 1980, via Krebs as developed in Davies, 1993)   survival of fledglings by clutch size     Use the graph to fill in the table of values for the number of fledglings raised in each situation.

Record your answers in the table.         Initial clutch size        Optimum clutch size         What conclusions can you draw in response to the question in the problem?    Drift of Pacific tectonic plate  The Big Island of Hawaii is the last island in a chain of islands and submarine mountain peaks that stretch almost 6000 kilometers across the Pacific Ocean. All are extinct volcanoes except for the Big Island itself, which is still active.  The ages of the extinct peaks are roughly proportional to their distance from the Big Island. Geologists believe that the volcanic islands were formed as the tectonic plate drifted across a hot spot in the Earth's mantle. The figure shows a map of the islands, scaled in kilometers. (Source: Open University, 1998)   Hawaiian islands    The tables give the ages of the islands, in millions of years. Estimate the distance from each island to the Big Island, along a straight-line path through their centers. Fill in the third row of the tables.

Draw a line of best fit through the data.  Calculate the slope of the line of best fit, including units.  Explain why the slope provides an estimate for the speed of the Pacific plate.    Cross section of earth's surface  The graph shows a cross section of Earth's surface along an east-west line from the coast of Africa through the Atlantic Ocean to South America. Both axes are scaled in kilometers. Use the figure to estimate the distances in this problem. (Source: Open University, 1998)  height of earth's surface    What is the highest land elevation shown in the figure? What is the lowest ocean depth shown? Give the horizontal coordinates of these two points, in kilometers west of the W longitude line.  How deep is the Atlantic Ocean directly above the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? How deep is the ocean above the abyssal plain on either side of the ridge?  What is the height of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge above the abyssal plain? What is the width of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge?  Using your answers to part (c), calculate the slope from the abyssal plain to the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, rounded to five decimal places  Estimate the slopes of the continental shelf, the continental slope, and the continental rise. Use the coordinates of the points indicated on the figure  Why do these slopes look much steeper in the accompanying figure than their numerical values suggest?     Mid-Atlantic Range  The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a mountain range on the sea floor beneath the Atlantic Ocean. It was discovered in the late nineteenth century during the laying of transatlantic telephone cables. The ridge is volcanic, and the ocean floor is moving away from the ridge on either side.  Geologists have estimated the speed of this sea-floor spreading by recording the age of the rocks on the sea floor and their distance from the ridge. (The age of the rocks is calculated by measuring their magnetic polarity. At known intervals over the last four million years, the Earth reversed its polarity, and this information is encoded in the rocks.) (Source: Open University, 1998)   According to the table, rocks that are million years old have moved kilometers from the ridge. What was the speed of spreading over the past million years? (This is the rate of spreading closest to the ridge.)  Plot the data in the table, with age on the horizontal axis and separation distance on the vertical axis. Draw a line of best fit through the data.  Calculate the slope of the regression line. What are the units of the slope?  The slope you calculated in part (c) represents the average spreading rate over the past million years. Is the average rate greater or smaller than the rate of spreading closest to the ridge?  Convert the average spreading rate to millimeters per year                 Age (millions of years)               Distance (km)                Naismith's rule Naismith's rule is used by runners and walkers to estimate journey times in hilly terrain. In 1892, Naismith wrote in the Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal that a person “in fair condition should allow for easy expeditions an hour for every three miles on the map, with an additional hour for every 2000 feet of ascent.” (Source: Scarf, 1998)  According to Naismith, one unit of ascent requires the same time as how many units of horizontal travel? (Convert miles to feet.) This is called Naismith's number . Round your answer to one decimal place  A walk in the Brecon Beacons in Wales covers kilometers horizontally and climbs meters. What is the equivalent flat distance?  If you can walk at a pace of minutes per kilometer over flat ground, how long will the walk in the Brecon Beacons take?

Part of the Karrimor International Mountain Marathon in the Arrochar Alps in Scotland has a choice of two routes. Route A is kilometers long with a -meter climb, and route B is kilometers long with a -meter climb. (Source: Scarf, 1998)  Which route is faster for women?  Which route is faster for men?

  "body": "Nonlinear Models  In Chapter 1, we considered models described by linear functions. In this chapter, we begin our study of nonlinear models.   Solving Nonlinear Equations  When studying nonlinear models, we will need to solve nonlinear equations. For example, in we used a graph to solve the quadratic equation  Here is another example. The figure shows a table and a graph for the function .  parabola                      You can see that there are two points on the graph for each -value greater than . For example, the two points with -coordinate are shown. To solve the equation we need only find the -coordinates of these points. From the graph, the solutions appear to be about and .  How can we solve this equation algebraically? The opposite operation for squaring a number is taking a square root. So we can undo the operation of squaring by extracting square roots. We first solve for to get and then take square roots to find  Don't forget that every positive number has two square roots. The symbol (read “plus or minus”) is a shorthand notation used to indicate both square roots of .   The exact solutions are thus and . We can also find decimal approximations for the solutions using a calculator. Rounded to two decimal places, the approximate solutions are and .  QuickCheck 1   Which statement is true?    A quadratic equation may include a linear or a constant term.    The solutions of a quadratic equation are always of the form .    Your calculator gives exact decimal values for square roots of integers.    The coefficients of a quadratic equation are called parabolas.          A quadratic equation may include a linear or a constant term.       In general, we can solve equations of the form by isolating on one side of the equation and then taking the square root of each side. This method for solving equations is called extraction of roots extraction of roots .  Extraction of Roots  To solve the equation   Isolate .  Take square roots of both sides. There are two solutions.     If a cat falls off a tree branch 20 feet above the ground, its height seconds later is given by .  What is the height of the cat second later?  How long does the cat have to get in position to land on its feet before it reaches the ground?    In this question, we are given a value of and asked to find the corresponding value of . To do this, we evaluate the formula for . We substitute for into the formula and simplify. The cat is feet above the ground after second.  We would like to find the value of when the height, , is known. We substitute into the equation to obtain To solve this equation, we use extraction of roots. First we isolate on one side of the equation. Then we take the square root of both sides of the equation to find   cat falling  Only the positive solution makes sense here, so the cat has approximately 1.12 seconds to get into position for landing.  A graph of the cat's height after seconds is shown at left. The points corresponding to parts (a) and (b) are labeled.    QuickCheck 2   Which solutions are approximations?    ;    ;    ;    ;                In part (a) of we evaluated the expression to find a value for , and in part (b) we solved the equation to find a value for .  Practice 1     Solve by extracting roots    Note: Use sqrt(2) to get etc.    Give exact answers above; then give approximations rounded to two decimal places.   Note: Enter a comma between solutions.                          Pause and Reflect   Use graphs to explain why a linear equation can have only one solution, but a quadratic equation may have two solutions.        Solving Formulas  We can use extraction of roots to solve many formulas involving the square of the variable.  The formula gives the volume of a cone in terms of its height and radius. Solve the formula for in terms of and .  Because the variable we want is squared, we use extraction of roots. First, we multiply both sides by to clear the fraction. Because the radius of a cone must be a positive number, we use only the positive square root: .  Practice 2   Find a formula for the radius of a circle in terms of its area.    Start with the formula for the area of a circle:  Solve for in terms of               More Extraction of Roots  Equations of the form can also be solved by extraction of roots after isolating the squared expression, .  Solve the equation  First, we isolate the perfect square, . This gives us two equations for , The solutions are and .  Here is a general strategy for solving equations by extraction of roots.  Extraction of Roots  To solve the equation   Isolate the squared expression, .  Take the square root of each side of the equation. Remember that a positive number has two square roots.  Solve each equation. There are two solutions.   Practice 3   Solve by extracting roots.    Give your answers as exact values, separating the solutions with a comma.  Note: Use sqrt(2) to get and take care to use parentheses appropriately.  Use the Preview My Answers button to see if you have entered valid syntax.    Find approximations for the solutions to two decimal places, separating the solutions with a comma.                    or         QuickCheck 3   Which of the following equations cannot be solved by extraction of roots?                      The equation cannot be solved by extraction of roots.        Compound Interest and Inflation  Many savings institutions offer accounts on which the interest is compounded annually . At the end of each year, the interest earned is added to the principal, and the interest for the next year is computed on this larger sum of money.  Compound Interest  If interest is compounded annually for years, the amount, , of money in an account is given by where is the principal and is the interest rate, expressed as a decimal fraction.    Carmella invests $3000 in an account that pays an interest rate, , compounded annually.  Write an expression for the amount of money in Carmella’s account after two years.  What interest rate would be necessary for Carmella's account to grow to $3500 in two years?    We use the formula above with and . Carmella’s account balance will be  We substitute for in the equation. We can solve this equation in by extraction of roots. First, we isolate the perfect square. Because the interest rate must be a positive number, we discard the negative solution. Carmella needs an account with interest rate , or just over 8%, to achieve an account balance of $3500 in two years.  QuickCheck 4   What is the first step in solving the equation    Expand .    Get zero on one side.    Divide both sides by 2.    Take the square root of both sides.          To solve by extraction of roots, we first divide both sides by 2.       The formula for compound interest also applies to the effects of inflation. For instance, if there is a steady inflation rate of 4% per year, in two years an item that now costs $100 will cost  Practice 4   Two years ago, the average cost of dinner and a movie was $24. This year the average cost is $25.44. What was the rate of inflation over the past two years?  %        or as a percent,        Other Nonlinear Equations  Because squaring and taking square roots are opposite operations, we can solve the equation by squaring both sides to get Similarly, we can solve by taking the cube root of both sides, because cubing and taking cube roots are opposite operations. Rounding to three places, we find  QuickCheck 5   Delbert squared by entering into his calculator, and got What went wrong?    Nothing; that is the right answer.    He should have put parentheses around .    He should have put parentheses around .    You cannot square a negative number on a calculator.          To square Delbert should have put parentheses around       The notion of undoing operations can help us solve a variety of simple nonlinear equations. The operation of taking a reciprocal is its own opposite, so we solve the equation by taking the reciprocal of both sides to get  Solve  We begin by taking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation to get We continue to undo the operations in reverse order. First, we multiply both sides by . The solution is , or .  QuickCheck 6   What is the reciprocal of                      The reciprocal of is       Practice 5   Solve               Pause and Reflect   What is the difference between a rational number and an irrational number?

Compound Interest  If interest is compounded annually for years, the amount, , of money in an account is given by where is the principal and is the interest rate, expressed as a decimal fraction.    We can give exact answers to a simple nonlinear equation, or we can give decimal approximations.  Simple nonlinear equations can be solved by undoing the operations on the variable.

  "body": " Some Basic Functions  In this section, we study the graphs of some important basic functions. Many functions fall into families or classes of similar functions, and recognizing the appropriate family for a given situation is an important part of modeling.  We begin by reviewing the absolute value.   Absolute Value  The absolute value is used to discuss problems involving distance. For example, consider the number line shown below. Starting at the origin, we travel in opposite directions to reach the two numbers and , but the distance we travel in each case is the same.  absolute value  The distance from a number to the origin is called the absolute value absolute value of , denoted by . Because distance is never negative, the absolute value of a number is always positive (or zero). Thus, and . In general, we define the absolute value of a number as follows.  Absolute Value  The absolute value of is defined by  This definition says that the absolute value of a positive number (or zero) is the same as the number. To find the absolute value of a negative number, we take the opposite of the number, which results in a positive number. For instance,  QuickCheck 1   If what can you say about    must be zero.    must be negative.    must be zero or negative.    This cannot happen for any value of .          must be zero or negative if       Absolute value bars act like grouping devices in the order of operations: You should complete any operations that appear inside absolute value bars before you compute the absolute value.  Simplify each expression.      We simplify the expression inside the absolute value bars first.  We simplify each absolute value; then subtract.   Practice 1   Simplify each expression.                                   Examples of Models  Many situations can be modeled by a handful of simple functions. The following examples represent applications of eight useful functions.  The contractor for a new hotel is estimating the cost of the marble tile for a circular lobby. The cost is a function of the square of the diameter of the lobby.  The number of board-feet that can be cut from a Ponderosa pine is a function of the cube of the circumference of the tree at a standard height.   parabola  cubic  The manager of an appliance store must decide how many coffee-makers to order every quarter. The optimal order size is a function of the square root of the annual demand for coffeemakers.  Investors are deciding whether to support a windmill farm. The wind speed needed to generate a given amount of power is a function of the cube root of the power.   square root  cube root  The frequency of the note produced by a violin string is a function of the reciprocal of the length of the string.  The loudness, or intensity, of the music at a concert is a function of the reciprocal of the square of your distance from the speakers.   inverse  cube root  The annual return on an investment is a linear function of the interest rate.  You are flying from Los Angeles to New York. Your distance from the Mississippi River is an absolute value function of time.   linear  absolute value  We will consider each of these functions and their applications in more detail in later sections. For now, you should become familiar with the properties of each graph and be able to sketch them easily from memory.  Eight Basic Functions   Part I Some Powers   Complete the table of values for the squaring function, , and the cubing function, . Then sketch each function on graph paper, using the table values to help you scale the axes.  Verify both graphs with your graphing calculator.  State the intervals on which each graph is increasing.  Write a few sentences comparing the two graphs. The graph of is called a parabola parabola , and the graph of is called a cubic cubic .

Then sketch each function on graph paper, using the table values to help you scale the axes.  Verify both graphs with your graphing calculator.  State the intervals on which each graph is increasing.  Write a few sentences comparing the two graphs.                                                                   Part III Asymptotes   Complete the table for the functions What is true about and ?  Prepare a grid on graph paper, scaling both axes from to . Plot the points from the table and connect them with smooth curves.  As increases through larger and larger values, what happens to the values of ? Extend your graph to reflect your answer.  What happens to as decreases through larger and larger negative values (that is, for )? Extend your graph for these -values.                                                     As the values of get larger in absolute value, the graph approaches the -axis. However, because never equals zero for any -value, the graph never actually touches the -axis. We say that the -axis is a horizontal asymptote horizontal asymptote for the graph.  Repeat step (3) for the graph of .  Next we'll examine the graphs of and near .   Use your calculator to evaluate for several -values close to zero and record the results in the tables below.                                                      What happens to the values of as approaches zero? Extend your graph of to reflect your answer.  As approaches zero from the left (through negative values), the function values decrease toward . As approaches zero from the right (through positive values), the function values increase toward . The graph approaches but never touches the vertical line (the -axis.)We say that the graph of has a vertical asymptote vertical asymptote at .  Repeat step (1) for the graph of .  The functions and are examples of rational functions rational function , so called because they are fractions, or ratios. Verify both graphs with your graphing calculator.

Some Properties of Absolute Value  In , we saw that for most functions, is not equal to . We may be able to find some values of and for which is true, but if it is not true for all values of and , we cannot claim that for that function.  For example, for the function , if we choose and , then so we have proved that for the squaring function. (In fact, we already knew this because as long as neither nor is .)  What about multiplication? Which of the basic functions have the property that for all and ? You will consider this question in the homework problems, but in particular you will need to recall the following properties of absolute value.  Properties of Absolute Value    Verify the triangle inequality for three cases: and are both positive, and are both negative, and and have opposite signs.   We choose positive values for and , say and . Then so .  For the second case, we choose and . Then so .  For the third case, we choose and . Then so . In each case, .   Note that verifying a statement for one or two values of the variables does not prove the statement is true for all values of the variables. However, working with examples can help us understand the meaning and significance of mathematical properties.  Practice 2   Verify the multiplicative property of absolute value for the three cases in the previous example.

We indicate this with a solid dot at the point .  In the right-hand region ( ), we graph the horizontal line . The value is not included in the second region, so the point is not part of the graph.

What happens to the values of as approaches zero? Extend your graph of to reflect your answer.  As approaches zero from the left (through negative values), the function values decrease toward . As approaches zero from the right (through positive values), the function values increase toward . The graph approaches but never touches the vertical line (the -axis.)We say that the graph of has a vertical asymptote vertical asymptote at .  Repeat step (1) for the graph of .  The functions and are examples of rational functions rational function , so called because they are fractions, or ratios. Verify both graphs with your graphing calculator. Use the window  State the intervals on which each graph is increasing.  Write a few sentences comparing the two graphs.   Part IV Absolute Value   Complete the table for the two functions and . Then sketch each function on graph paper, using the table values to help you scale the axes.  Verify both graphs with your graphing calculator. Your calculator uses the notation instead of for the absolute value of . First, position the cursor after in the graphing window. Now access the absolute value function by pressing 2nd  for CATALOG ; then ENTER for abs( . Don’t forget to press if you want to graph .  State the intervals on which each graph is increasing.  Write a few sentences comparing the two graphs.                                                     "

  "body": " Transformations of Graphs  Models for real situations are often variations of the basic functions introduced in . In this section, we explore how certain changes in the formula for a function affect its graph. In particular, we will compare the graph of with the graphs of for different values of the constants , , and . Such variations are called transformations transformations of the graph.   Vertical Translations The figure below shows the graphs of , , and the basic parabola, . By comparing tables of values, we can see exactly how the graphs of and are related to the basic parabola.   parabolas                                                 Each -value in the table for is four units greater than the corresponding -value for the basic parabola. Consequently, each point on the graph of is four units higher than the corresponding point on the basic parabola, as shown by the arrows. Similarly, each point on the graph of is four units lower than the corresponding point on the basic parabola.  The graphs of and are said to be translations translations of the graph of . They are shifted to a different location in the plane but retain the same size and shape as the original graph. In general, we have the following principles.  Vertical Translations  Compared with the graph of ,  The graph of is shifted upward  units.  The graph of is shifted downward  units.     Graph the following functions.      The table shows that the -values for are each three units greater than the corresponding -values for the absolute value function. The graph of is a translation of the basic graph of , shifted upward three units, as shown below.   translate absolute value                         The table shows that the -values for are each two units smaller than the corresponding -values for . The graph of is a translation of the basic graph of , shifted downward two units, as shown below.    translate reciprocal                          QuickCheck 1   The graph of has a vertical asymptote at What happens to the asymptote under a vertical translation?    Nothing.    It is compressed vertically.    It is translated vertically.    It is eliminated.          Nothing: a vertical asymptote does not change when a graph undergoes a vertical translation.

Sketch a graph of and interpret its meaning.  electrical power   The graph of is a vertical translation of the graph of , as shown at right. At each hour of the day, or for each value of , the -coordinate is 300 greater than on the graph of . So at each hour, the community is drawing 300 megawatts more power than in 2002.  electrical power   Practice 2  swamp cooler graphs    An evaporative cooler, or swamp cooler, is an energy-efficient type of air conditioner used in dry climates. A typical swamp cooler can reduce the temperature inside a house by 15 degrees.  Figure (a) shows the graph of \\(T = f (t)\\), the temperature inside Kate s house \\(t\\) hours after she turns on the swamp cooler. Write a formula in terms of \\(f\\) for the function \\(g\\) shown in figure (b), and give a possible explanation of its meaning.     is the temperature in the house on a day that was hotter.    is the temperature in the house on a day that was cooler.    is the temperature in the house 10 hours after turning on the swamp cooler.               The outside temperature was hotter.        Horizontal Translations  Now consider the graphs of shown below. Compared with the graph of the basic function , the graph of is shifted two units to the left , as shown by the arrows.  graphs  You can see why this happens by studying the function values in the table.  Locate a particular -value for , say, . You must move two units to the left in the table to find the same -value for , as shown by the arrow. In fact, each -value for occurs two units to the left when compared to the same -value for .  table for left translation  table for right translation  Similarly, the graph of is shifted two units to the right compared to the graph of . In the table for , each -value for occurs two units to the right of the same -value for . In general, we have the following principle.  Horizontal Translations  Compared with the graph of ,  The graph of is shifted units to the left .  The graph of is shifted units to the right .   At first, the direction of a horizontal translation may seem counterintuitive. Look again at the tables above to help you see how the shift occurs.  Graph the following functions.      Consider the table of values for the function.            undefined              The table shows that each -value for occurs one unit to the left of the same -value for the graph of . Consequently, each point on the graph of is shifted one unit to the left of , as shown at right. horizontal shift of square root  Consider the table of values for the function.              undefined            undefined    The table shows that each -value for occurs three units to the right of the same -value for the graph of .

For what pressure readings could a doctor be fairly certain that a patient has glaucoma?    The graph of is translated units to the right of , so .  Pressure readings above are a strong indication of glaucoma. Readings between and cannot conclusively distinguish healthy eyes from those with glaucoma.   Practice 4  shift of caffeine surge curve    The function shown above gives the caffeine level in Delbert s bloodstream at time hours after he drinks a cup of coffee, and gives the caffeine level in Francine s bloodstream. Write a formula for in terms of and explain what it tells you about Delbert and Francine.     A) Francine drank her coffee 3 hours after Delbert drank his.    B) Delbert drank his coffee 3 hours after Francine drank hers.    C) Francine drank 3 time as much coffee as Delbert drank.    D) Francine drank 3 more cups of coffee than Delbert drank.               Francine drank her coffee hours after Delbert drank his.       Graph  We identify the basic graph from the structure of the formula for . In this case, the basic graph is , so we begin by locating a few points on that graph, say, and   We'll perform the translations separately, following the order of operations. First, we sketch a graph of by shifting each point on the basic graph four units to the left. We then move each point up two units to obtain the graph of . All three graphs are shown below.  translations of cubic curve  Practice 5     Graph the function    How is the graph of different from the graph of    Translate two units left and one unit down.

Translate one unit down and two units right.         A graph for part (a):  shifted absolute value   Pause and Reflect   Horizontal translations are less intuitive than vertical translations. What explanation helps you understand them?        Scale Factors  We have seen that adding a constant to the expression defining a function results in a translation of its graph. What happens if we multiply the expression by a constant? Consider the graphs of the functions shown below, and compare each to the graph of .   2 x-sq and basic parabola                            Compared to the graph of , the graph of is expanded, or stretched, vertically by a factor of . The -coordinate of each point on the graph has been doubled, as you can see in the table of values, so each point on the graph of is twice as far from the -axis as its counterpart on the basic graph .   half x-sq and basic parabola                            The graph of is compressed vertically by a factor of ; each point is half as far from the -axis as its counterpart on the graph of .   negative x-sq and basic parabola                            The graph of is flipped, or reflected, about the -axis; the -coordinate of each point on the graph of is replaced by its opposite.  In general, we have the following principles.  Scale Factors and Reflections  Compared with the graph of , the graph of , where , is  stretched vertically by a factor of if ,  compressed vertically by a factor of if , and  reflected about the -axis if .   The constant is called the scale factor for the graph.  QuickCheck 3   The graph of is symmetric about the -axis. Which of the following graphs is also symmetric about the -axis??

Each point on the basic graph has its -coordinate tripled.  scale cube root  The graph of is a vertical compression of the basic graph by a factor of , combined with a reflection about the -axis. You may find it helpful to graph the function in two steps, as shown below.  scale absolute value   Practice 6     Graph the function    How is the graph of different from the graph of    Translate one unit up.    Translate one unit right.    Stretch by a factor of 2.    Shrink by a factor of .              A graph is shown below.    Stretch vertically by a factor of 2 to obtain the graph of         A graph for part (a):  shifted absolute value   QuickCheck 4   Under which transformations does the graph of a function keep the same shape?    Vertical translation    Horizontal translation    Reflection    All of these          The graph of a function keep the same shape under all of these transformations.       The function graphed below gives a person's blood alcohol level hours after drinking a martini. Sketch a graph of and explain what it tells you.  alcohol level after alcohol  To sketch a graph of , we stretch the graph of vertically by a factor of , as shown below. At each time , the person’s blood alcohol level is twice the value given by . The function could represent a person's blood alcohol level hours after drinking two martinis.  alcohol level after more alcohol  Practice 7  daylight hours at two latitudes    If the Earth were not tilted on its axis, there would be 12 daylight hours every day all over the planet. But in fact, the length of a day in a particular location depends on the latitude and the time of year.  The graph above shows the length of a day in Helsinki, Finland, days after January 1, and the length of a day in Rome. Each is expressed as the number of hours greater or less than 12. Write a formula for in terms of   What does this formula tell you?  On any given day, the number of daylight hours varies from 12 hours by about...    A) 2 hours more in Helsinki as in Rome.    B) 3 hours more in Helsinki as in Rome.    C) twice as much in Helsinki as in Rome.    D) half as much in Helsinki as in Rome.               On any given day, the number of daylight hours varies from hours about twice as much in Helsinki as it does in Rome.       Pause and Reflect   In this section we did not consider reflections about the -axis. Can you think of a way to alter the formula for to reflect the graph about the -axis? Which of the eight basic graphs would not be affected by such a reflection?         Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

  "body": " Functions as Mathematical Models  The Shape of the Graph  Creating a good model for a situation often begins with deciding what kind of function to use. An appropriate model can depend on very qualitative considerations, such as the general shape of the graph. What sort of function has the right shape to describe the process we want to model? Should it be increasing or decreasing, or some combination of both? Is the slope constant or is it changing?  In Examples and , we investigate how the shape of a graph illustrates the nature of the process it models.   Forrest leaves his house to go to school. For each of the following situations, sketch a possible graph of Forrest's distance from home as a function of time.  Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop.  Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop; then he waits there until the bus arrives.  Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop, waits there until the bus arrives, and then the bus drives him to school at a constant speed.    The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in figure (a). It begins at the origin because at the instant Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when .) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrest’s walking speed.  distance from home  The graph begins like the graph in part (a). But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in figure (b). The line has slope because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is .  The graph begins like the graph in part (b). The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in figure (c).   Practice 1   Erin walks from her home to a convenience store, where she buys some cat food, and then walks back home. Sketch a possible graph of her distance from home as a function of time.       The graph of Erin s distance from home is    (A)    (B)    (C)    (D)    none of the above            A graph is also shown below.       Alternate graph:  piecewise graph   The graphs in are piecewise linear, because Forrest traveled at a constant rate in each segment. In addition to choosing a graph that is increasing, decreasing, or constant to model a process, we can consider graphs that bend upward or downward. The bend is called the concavity concavity of the graph.  The two functions described in this example are both increasing functions, but they increase in different ways. Match each function to its graph and to the appropriate table of values.  The number of flu cases reported at an urban medical center during an epidemic is an increasing function of time, and it is growing at a faster and faster rate.  The temperature of a potato placed in a hot oven increases rapidly at first, then more slowly as it approaches the temperature of the oven.                                   increasing graphs of opposite concavity   The number of flu cases is described by graph (A) and table (1). The function values in table (1) increase at an increasing rate. We can see this by computing the rate of change over successive time intervals. The increasing rates can be seen inthe figure below; the graph bends upward as the slopes increase.  cocave up graph  The temperature of the potato is described by graph (B) and table (2). The function values in table (2) increase, but at a decreasing rate. The decreasing slopes can be seen in the figure below. The graph is increasing but bends downward.  cocave down graph   A graph that bends upward is called concave up , and one that bends down is concave down .  QuickCheck 1   A graph whose slopes decrease for increasing is called    increasing.    decreasing.    concave up.    concave down.          A graph whose slopes decrease for increasing is called concave down.       Practice 2  decreasing graphs of opposite concavity    Francine bought a cup of cocoa at the cafeteria. The cocoa cooled off rapidly at first, and then gradually approached room temperature. Which graph more accurately reflects the temperature of the cocoa as a function of time?   (a)    (b)    Explain why. (Select all that apply.)    The graph has a steep negative slope at first, corresponding to an initial rapid drop in the temperature of the cocoa.   Yes    No      The graph becomes closer to a horizontal line, corresponding to the cocoa approaching room temperature.   Yes    No      The graph has a slight negative slope at first, corresponding to an initial rapid drop in the temperature of the cocoa.   Yes    No      The graph becomes grows steeper and steeper, corresponding to the cocoa approaching room temperature.   Yes    No      Is the graph you chose concave up or concave down?   Concave up    Concave down                                   Graph (a): The graph has a steep negative slope at first, corresponding to an initial rapid drop in the temperature of the cocoa. The graph becomes closer to a horizontal line, corresponding to the cocoa approaching room temperature. The graph is concave up.       Pause and Reflect   How can you tell from a table of values whether a function is concave up or concave down?        Using the Basic Functions as Models  In this section, we consider some situations that can be modeled by the basic functions. illustrates an application of the function .  The speed of sound is a function of the temperature of the air in kelvins. (The temperature, , in kelvins is given by , where is the temperature in degrees Celsius.) The table shows the speed of sound, , in meters per second, at various temperatures, .                    Plot the data to obtain a graph. Which of the basic functions does your graph most resemble?  Find a value of so that fits the data.  On a summer night when the temperature is Celsius, you see a flash of lightning, and seconds later you hear the thunderclap. Use your function to estimate your distance from the thunderstorm.    The graph of the data is shown below. The shape of the graph reminds us of the square root function, . speed of sound  We are looking for a value of so that the function fits the data. We substitute one of the data points into the formula and solve for . If we choose the point , we obtain and solving for yields . We can check that the formula is a good fit for the rest of the data points as well. Thus, we suggest the function as a model for the speed of sound.  First, we use the model to calculate the speed of sound at a temperature of Celsius. The Kelvin temperature is so we evaluate for . Thus, is approximately 343.4 meters per second.  The lightning and the thunderclap occur simultaneously, and the speed of light is so fast (about 30,000,000 meters per second) that we see the lightning flash as it occurs. So if the sound of the thunderclap takes seconds after the flash to reach us, we can use our calculated speed of sound to find our distance from the storm. The thunderstorm is meters, or about miles, away.  QuickCheck 2   Which graph is concave down wherever it is defined?                      The graph of is concave down.       Practice 3   The ultraviolet index (UVI) is issued by the National Weather Service as a forecast of the amount of ultraviolet radiation expected to reach Earth around noon on a given day. The data show how much exposure to the sun people can take before risking sunburn.              UVI            Minutes to burn (more sensitive)            Minutes to burn (more sensitive)              Plot the minutes to burn, against the UVI, to obtain two graphs, one for people who are more sensitive to sunburn, and another for people less sensitive to sunburn. Which of the basic functions do your graphs most resemble?                              For each graph, find a value of so that fits the data.  More sensitive:  Less sensitive:                      The graphs are shown below. The shapes of the graphs resemble    More sensitive: Less sensitive:         The graphs for part (a):  two concave up decreasing curves   QuickCheck 3   To decide which basic function might model a set of data, we can    plot the data.    look at the variables.    choose scales for the axes.    calculate the slope.          To decide which basic function might model a set of data, we can plot the data.       At this point, a word of caution is in order. There is more to choosing a model than finding a curve that fits the data. A model based purely on the data is called an empirical model empirical model . However, many functions have similar shapes over small intervals of their input variables, and there may be several candidates that model the data. Such a model simply describes the general shape of the data set; the parameters of the model do not necessarily correspond to any actual process.  In contrast, mechanistic models mechanistic models provide insight into the biological, chemical, or physical process that is thought to govern the phenomenon under study. Parameters derived from mechanistic models are quantitative estimates of real system properties. Here is what GraphPad Software has to say about modeling:  \"Choosing a model is a scientific decision. You should base your choice on your understanding of chemistry or physiology (or genetics, etc.). The choice should not be based solely on the shape of the graph.  \"Some programs . . . automatically fit data to hundreds or thousands of equations and then present you with the equation(s) that fit the data best. Using such a program is appealing because it frees you from the need to choose an equation. The problem is that the program has no understanding of the scientific context of your experiment. The equations that fit the data best are unlikely to correspond to scientifically meaningful models. You will not be able to interpret the best-fit values of the variables, and the results are unlikely to be useful for data analysis.\"  (Source: Fitting Models to Biological Data Using Linear and Nonlinear Regression , Motulsky & Christopoulos, GraphPad Software, 2003)  Pause and Reflect   Explain the difference between an empirical model and a mechanistic model.        Modeling with Piecewise Functions  Recall that a piecewise function is defined by different formulas on different portions of the -axis.  In 2005, the income tax for a single taxpayer with a taxable income under $150,000 was given by the following table.           If taxpayer's income is...  Then the estimated tax is...

Write a piecewise function for .  Graph the function .    An income of is in the first tax bracket, so the tax is The income is just on the upper edge of the second tax bracket. The amount over $7300 is $29,700 - $7300, so The income is in the third bracket, so the tax is  The first two columns of the table give the tax brackets, or the -intervals on which each piece of the function is defined. In each bracket, the tax is given by For example, the tax in the second bracket is Writing the formulas for each of the four tax brackets gives us  The graph of is piecewise linear.  The first piece starts at the origin and has slope .  The second piece is in point-slope form, , so it has slope and passes through the point .  Similarly, the third piece has slope and passes through .  The fourth piece has slope and passes through .  You can check that for this function, all four pieces are connected at their endpoints, as shown below.  income tax graph   QuickCheck 4   A piecewise function    must have no breaks in its graph.    can have more than one output at some inputs.    cannot have concavity.    none of the above          none of the above       Practice 4   As part of a water conservation program, the utilities commission in Arid, New Mexico, establishes a two-tier system of monthly billing for residential water usage: The commission charges a $30 service fee plus $2 per hundred cubic feet (HCF) of water if you use 50 HCF or less, and a $50 service fee plus $3 per HCF of water if you use over 50 HCF (1 HCF of water is about 750 gallons).

Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.  Increasing  Decreasing  Concave up  Concave down  Empirical model  Mechanistic model     CONCEPTS    The shape of a graph describes how the output variable changes.  A nonlinear graph may be concave up or concave down. If a graph is concave up, its slope is increasing. If it is concave down, its slope is decreasing.  The basic functions can be used to model physical situations.  Some situations can be modeled by piecewise functions  Fitting a curve to the data is not enough to produce a useful model; appropriate scientific principles should also be considered.

Lead nitrate and potassium iodide react in solution to produce lead iodide, which settles out, or precipitates, as a yellow solid at the bottom of the container.

As the global population increases, many scientists believe it is approaching, or has already exceeded, the maximum number the Earth can sustain. This maximum number, or carrying capacity, depends on the finite natural resources of the planet—water, land, air, and materials—but also on how people use and preserve the resources. The graphs show four different ways that a growing population can approach its carrying capacity over time. (Source: Meadows, Randers, and Meadows, 2004)  4 models of population meeting carrying capacity  Match each graph to one of the scenarios described in (a) (d) and explain your choice.  Sigmoid growth: The population levels off smoothly below the carrying capacity.  Overshoot and collapse: The population exceeds the carrying capacity with severe damage to the resource base and is forced to decline rapidly to achieve a new balance with a reduced carrying capacity.  Continued growth: The carrying capacity is far away, or growing faster than the population.  Overshoot and oscillation: The population exceeds the carrying capacity without inflicting permanent damage, then oscillates around the limit before leveling off.   II  IV  I  III   The introduction of a new species into an environment can affect the growth of an existing species in various ways. The graphs show four hypothetical scenarios after Species A is introduced into an environment where Species B is established.  4 models of 2 interacting populations  Match each graph to one of the scenarios described in (a) (d) and explain your choice.  Predator-prey (sustained): Species A becomes a predator population that grows when its prey, Species B, is abundant, but declines when the prey population is small. The prey population grows when predators are scarce but shrinks when predators are abundant.  Predator-prey (extinction): Species A becomes a predator population that annihilates Species B, but then Species A itself declines toward extinction.  Competition: Species A and B have a common food source, and the Species A replaces Species B in the environment.  Symbiosis: Species A and B help each other to grow.     "

The lightning and the thunderclap occur simultaneously, and the speed of light is so fast (about 30,000,000 meters per second) that we see the lightning flash as it occurs.

Because of the multiplicative property of the absolute value, namely that , we can write the left side as which tells us that the distance between and is units, so the solutions are and .   Alternatively, we can use graphs when working with absolute values. For example, we know that the simple equation has two solutions, and .

The mall is only 15 miles from Marlene’s on-ramp, but she mistakenly drives past the mall and continues down the highway. Marlene's distance from the mall is a function of how far she has driven on Highway 17.  highway 17 with gas station and mall   Make a table of values showing how far Marlene has driven on Highway 17 and how far she is from the mall.

Find a piecewise defined formula that describes Marlene’s distance from the mall as a function of the distance she has driven on the highway.

But it is unlikely that the sample weighs exactly  grams; there is always some error in measured values.  Because the scale shows the weight as grams, we know that the true weight of the sample must be between grams and grams: If the weight were less than grams, the scale would round down to grams, and if the weight were more than grams, the scale would round up to grams. We should report the mass of the sample as grams, which tells the reader that the error in the measurement is no more than grams.  We can also describe this measurement error, or error tolerance error tolerance , using an absolute value inequality.

For this function, we must choose -values in the interval .   square root graph  All the points on the graph have -coordinates greater than or equal to , as shown at left. The set of all permissible values of the input variable is called the domain domain of the function .   We also see that there are no points with negative -values on the graph of : All the points have -values greater than or equal to zero. The set of all outputs or function values corresponding to the domain is called the range range of the function. Thus, the domain of the function is the interval , and its range is the interval . In general, we make the following definitions.  Domain and Range  The domain domain of a function is the set of permissible values for the input variable. The range range is the set of function values (that is, values of the output variable) that correspond to the domain values.  Using the notions of domain and range, we restate the definition of a function as follows.  Definition of Function  A relationship between two variables is a function function if each element of the domain is paired with exactly one element of the range.  QuickCheck 1   In a function, how many domain elements can be paired with one range element?    One    Two    None    Infinitely many          It is possible that infinitely many domain elements can be paired with one range element.        Finding Domain and Range from a Graph  We can identify the domain and range of a function from its graph. The domain is the set of -values of all points on the graph, and the range is the set of -values.    Determine the domain and range of the function graphed at right.  For the indicated points, show the domain values and their corresponding range values in the form of ordered pairs.   graph of function    All the points on the graph have -coordinates between and , inclusive, so the domain of the function is the interval . The -coordinates have values between and , inclusive, so the range of the function is the interval .  Recall that the points on the graph of a function have coordinates . In other words, the coordinates of each point are made up of a domain value and its corresponding range value. Read the coordinates of the indicated points to obtain the ordered pairs , , , , and .     graph of function with enclosing rectangle  The figure at left shows the graph of the function in with the domain values marked on the horizontal axis and the range values marked on the vertical axis. Imagine a rectangle whose length and width are determined by those segments, as shown in the figure. All the points on the graph of the function lie within this rectangle.  The rectangle described above is a convenient window in the plane for viewing the function. Of course, if the domain or range of the function is an infinite interval, we can never include the whole graph within a viewing rectangle and must be satisfied with studying only the important parts of the graph.  Practice 1  graph of function      Draw the smallest viewing window possible around the graph shown above.    Find the domain and range of the function.  Domain:  Range:               A graph is shown below.  domain: range:       curving touching sides of window    Sometimes the domain is given as part of the definition of a function.  Graph the function on the domain and give its range.  The graph is part of a parabola that opens upward. We obtain several points on the graph by evaluating the function at convenient -values in the domain.                                        The range of the function is the set of all -values that appear on the graph. We can see that the lowest point on the graph is , so the smallest -value is . The highest point on the graph is , so the largest -value is . Thus, the range of the function is the interval .  parabola with x from 0 to 4   Practice 2   Graph the function on the domain and give its range.

The function changes concavity on its domain.       Not all functions have domains and ranges that are intervals.   The table gives the postage for sending printed material by first-class mail in 2016. Graph the postage function .    Weight in ounces  Postage    $0.47    $0.68    $0.89    $1.10    $1.31    $1.52    $1.73   Determine the domain and range of the function.    From the table, we see that articles of any weight up to ounce require $0.47 postage. This means that for all -values greater than but less than or equal to , the -value is . Thus, the graph of between and looks like a small piece of the horizontal line .  Similarly, for all -values greater than but less than or equal to , the -value is , so the graph on this interval looks like a small piece of the line . Continue in this way to obtain the graph shown below.  postage step function  The open circles at the left endpoint of each horizontal segment indicate that that point is not included in the graph; the closed circles are points on the graph. For instance, if , the postage, , is $0.89, not $1.10. Consequently, the point is part of the graph of , but the point is not.  Postage rates are given for all weights greater than ounces up to and including ounces, so the domain of the function is the half-open interval . (The domain is an interval because there is a point on the graph for every -value from to .)  The range of the function is not an interval, however, because the possible values for do not include all the real numbers between and . The range is the set of discrete values , , , , , , and .   QuickCheck 3   Which function includes all real numbers in its range?                      The function includes all real numbers in its range.

Give an example.        Finding the Domain from a Formula  If the domain of a function is not given as part of its definition, we assume that the domain is as large as possible. We include in the domain all -values that make sense when substituted into the function's formula.   For example, the domain of the function is the interval , because -values less than or greater than result in square roots of negative numbers. You may recognize the graph of as the upper half of the circle , as shown at right.  graph of upper half circle  QuickCheck 4   The domain of the function is What is the domain of the function                      The domain of is       Find the domain of the function  We must omit any -values that do not make sense in the function's formula. Because division by zero is undefined, we cannot allow the denominator of to be zero. Since when , we exclude from the domain of . Thus, the domain of is the set of all real numbers except .

Range:         A graph for part (a):  GC graph   For the functions we have studied so far, there are only two operations we must avoid when finding the domain: division by zero and taking the square root of a negative number.  Many common functions have as their domain the entire set of real numbers. In particular, a linear function can be evaluated at any real number value of , so its domain is the set of all real numbers. This set is represented in interval notation as .  The range of the linear function (if ) is also the set of all real numbers, because the graph continues infinitely at both ends, as shown in figure (a). If , then , and the graph of is a horizontal line. In this case, the range consists of a single number, .  increasing line and horizontal line  QuickCheck 5   Which operations must we examine when finding the domain of a function?    absolute value and square roots    square roots and cube roots    square roots and division by zero    absolute value and division by zero          We must examine square roots and division by zero when finding the domain of a function defined by a formula.       Pause and Reflect   State the domain and range of each function:        Restricting the Domain  In many applications, we may restrict the domain of a function to suit the situation at hand.  The function gives the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of the Sears Tower as a function of time. Give a suitable domain for this application, and the corresponding range.  You can use the window to obtain the graph shown at right.  GC graph of falling algebra book function  Because represents the time in seconds after the book was dropped, only positive -values make sense for the problem. The book stops falling when it hits the ground, at . You can verify that this happens at approximately seconds. Thus, only -values between and are realistic for this application, so we restrict the domain of the function to the interval .  During that time period, the height, , of the book decreases from feet to feet. The range of the function on the domain is .

Domain  Range  Restricted domain     CONCEPTS    The domain of a function is the set of permissible values for the input variable.  The range is the set of function values (that is, values of the output variable) that correspond to the domain values.  A relationship between two variables is a function if each element of the domain is paired with only one element of the range.  We can identify the domain and range of a function from its graph. The domain is the set of -values of all points on the graph, and the range is the set of -values.  If the domain of a function is not given as part of its definition, we assume that the domain is as large as possible.  In applications, we may restrict the domain and range of a function to suit the situation at hand.     STUDY QUESTIONS   Explain how to find the domain and range of a function from its graph.

Simple nonlinear equations can be solved by undoing the operations on the variable.    The absolute value of is defined by       The absolute value has the following properties:     Triangle inequality     Multiplicative property      Many situations can be modeled by one of eight basic functions:                 Functions can be defined piecewise, with different formulas on different intervals.   Transformations of Functions   The graph of is shifted vertically compared to the graph of .  The graph of is shifted horizontally compared to the graph of .  The graph of is stretched or compressed vertically compared to the graph of y = f (x).  The graph of is reflected about the -axis compared to the graph of .     A nonlinear graph may be concave up or concave down . If a graph is concave up, its slope is increasing. If it is concave down, its slope is decreasing.  The absolute value is used to model distance: The distance between two points and is given by .   Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities   The equation is equivalent to   If the solutions of the equation are and , with , then the solutions of are .  If the solutions of the equation are and , with , then the solutions of are or .     We can use absolute value notation to express error tolerances in measurements.  The domain of a function is the set of permissible values for the input variable. The range is the set of function values (that is, values of the output variable) that correspond to the domain values.  A relationship between two variables is a function if each element of the domain is paired with only one element of the range.  We can identify the domain and range of a function from its graph. The domain is the set of input values of all points on the graph, and the range is the set of output values.  If the domain of a function is not given as part of its definition, we assume that the domain is as large as possible. In many applications, however, we may restrict the domain and range of a function to suit the situation at hand.

Inga runs hot water into the bathtub until it is about half full. Because the water is too hot, she lets it sit for a while before getting into the tub. After several minutes of bathing, she gets out and drains the tub. Graph the water level in the bathtub as a function of time, from the moment Inga starts filling the tub until it is drained. curve  David turns on the oven and it heats up steadily until the proper baking temperature is reached. The oven maintains that temperature during the time David bakes a pot roast. When he turns the oven off, David leaves the oven door open for a few minutes, and the temperature drops fairly rapidly during that time. After David closes the door, the temperature continues to drop, but at a much slower rate.

  "body": " Projects for Chapter 2: Periodic Functions   A periodic function periodic function is one whose values repeat at evenly spaced intervals, or periods periods , of the input variable. Periodic functions are used to model phenomena that exhibit cyclical behavior, such as growth patterns in plants and animals, radio waves, and planetary motion. In this project, we consider some applications of periodic functions.   Which of the functions in are periodic? If the function is periodic, give its period. three curves     This graph is periodic with period .  This graph is not periodic.  This graph is periodic with period .     Part I    Which of the functions are periodic? If the function is periodic, give its period.   three curves     Which of the functions are periodic? If the function is periodic, give its period.   four curves     Match each of the following situations with the appropriate graph.  four curves    When the heart contracts, blood pressure in the arteries rises rapidly to a peak (systolic blood pressure) and then falls off quickly to a minimum (diastolic blood pressure). Blood pressure is a periodic function of time.  After an injection is given to a patient, the amount of the drug present in his bloodstream decreases exponentially. The patient receives injections at regular intervals to restore the drug level to the prescribed level. The amount of the drug present is a periodic function of time.  The monorail shuttle train between the north and south terminals at Gatwick Airport departs from the south terminal every 12 minutes. The distance from the train to the south terminal is a periodic function of time.  Delbert gets a haircut every two weeks. The length of his hair is a periodic function of time.      A patient receives regular doses of medication to maintain a certain level of the drug in his body. After each dose, the patient's body eliminates a certain percent of the medication before the next dose is administered. The graph shows the amount of the drug, in milliliters, in the patient's body as a function of time in hours.  drug level over multiple doses    How much of the medication is administered with each dose?  How often is the medication administered?  What percent of the drug is eliminated from the body between doses?     You are sitting on your front porch late one evening, and you see a light coming down the road tracing out the path shown below, with distances in inches. You realize that you are seeing a bicycle light, fixed to the front wheel of the bike.   path of light on wheel    Approximately what is the period of the graph?  How far above the ground is the light?  What is the diameter of the bicycle wheel?     The graph shows arterial blood pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), as a function of time.   blood pressure    What are the maximum (systolic) and minimum (diastolic) pressures? The pulse pressure is the difference of systolic and diastolic pressures. What is the pulse pressure?  The mean arterial pressure is the diastolic pressure plus one-third of the pulse pressure. Calculate the mean arterial pressure and draw a horizontal line on the graph at that pressure.  The blood pressure graph repeats its cycle with each heartbeat. What is the heart rate, in beats per minute, of the person whose blood pressure is shown in the graph?     At a ski slope, the lift chairs take 5 minutes to travel from the bottom, at an elevation of 3000 feet, to the top, at elevation 4000 feet. The cable supporting the ski lift chairs is a loop turning on pulleys at a constant speed. At the top and bottom, the chairs are at a constant elevation for a few seconds to allow skiers to get on and off.  Sketch a graph of , the height of one chair at time . Show at least two complete up-and-down trips.  What is the period of ?      The heater in Paul's house doesn’t have a thermostat; it runs on a timer. It uses watts when it is running. Paul sets the heater to run from 6 a.m. to noon, and again from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Sketch a graph of , the power drawn by the heater as a function of time. Show at least two days of heater use.  What is the period of ?     Francine adds water to her fish pond once a week to keep the depth at centimeters. During the week, the water evaporates at a constant rate of centimeter per day.  Sketch a graph of , the depth of the water, as a function of time. Show at least two weeks.  What is the period of ?     Erin's fox terrier, Casey, is very energetic and bounces excitedly at dinner time. Casey can jump inches high,and each jump takes him second.  Sketch a graph of Casey's height, , as a function of time. Show at least two jumps.  What is the period of ?      Many periodic functions have a characteristic wave shape like the graph shown in . These graphs are called sinusoidal sinusoidal , after the trigonometric functions sine and cosine. They are often described by three parameters: the period period , midline midline , and amplitude amplitude .  The period of the graph is the smallest interval of input values on which the graph repeats. The midline is the horizontal line at the average of the maximum and minimum values of the output variable. The amplitude is the vertical distance between the maximum output value and the midline.  sinusoidal curve  The table shows the number of hours of daylight in Glasgow, Scotland, on the first of each month.

Estimate the period, amplitude, and midline of the graph.      Plot the data points and fit a sinusoidal curve by eye, as shown in .  sinusoidal length of day   The period of the graph is months. The midline is approximately , and the amplitude is approximately .     Part II    The graph shows the number of daylight hours in Jacksonville, in Anchorage, at the Arctic Circle, and at the Equator.   daylight hours at 3 locations    Which graph corresponds to each location?  What are the maximum and minimum number of daylight hours in Jacksonville?  For how long are there hours of daylight per day at the Arctic Circle?     Match each of the following situations with the appropriate graph.    The number of hours of daylight in Salt Lake City varies from a minimum of hours on the winter solstice to a maximum of hours on the summer solstice.  A weight is feet above the floor, suspended from the ceiling by a spring. The weight is pulled down to feet above the floor and released, rising past feet in second before attaining its maximum height of feet. Neglecting the effects of friction, the height of the weight will continue to oscillate between its minimum and maximum height.  The voltage used in U.S. electrical current changes from V to V and back times each second.  Although the moon is spherical, what we can see from Earth looks like a (sometimes only partly visible) disk. The percentage of the moon's disk that is visible varies between (at new moon) to (at full moon).    four sinusoidal graphs       As the moon revolves around the Earth, the percent of the disk that we see varies sinusoidally with a period of approximately 30 days. There are eight phases, starting with the new moon, when the moon's disk is dark, followed by waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon (when the disk is visible), waning gibbous, last quarter, and waning crescent.

Smaller values for the apparent magnitude correspond to brighter stars. The graph below, called a light curve, shows the apparent magnitude of the star Algol as a function of time. Algol is an eclipsing binary star, which means that it is actually a system of two stars, a bright principal star and its dimmer companion, in orbit around each other. As each star passes in front of the other, it eclipses some of the light that reaches Earth from the system. (Source: Gamow, 1965, Brandt & Maran, 1972)   light curve    The light curve is periodic.

  "body": "Variation  Two types of functions are widely used in modeling and are known by special names: direct variation and inverse variation .  Direct Variation direct variation  Two variables are directly proportional directly proportional (or just proportional proportional ) if the ratios of their corresponding values are always equal. Consider the functions described in the tables below. The first table shows the price of gasoline as a function of the number of gallons purchased.    Gallons of gasoline  Total price  Price\/ Gallons                         Years  Population  People\/Years                           The ratio , or price per gallon, is the same for each pair of values in the first table. This agrees with everyday experience: The price per gallon of gasoline is the same no matter how many gallons you buy. Thus, the total price of a gasoline purchase is directly proportional to the number of gallons purchased.  The second table shows the population of a small town as a function of the town’s age. The ratio gives the average rate of growth of the population in people per year. You can see that this ratio is not constant; in fact, it increases as time goes on. Thus, the population of the town is not proportional to its age.  QuickCheck 1   When does a table represent direct variation?    If it has a constant slope    If it includes the point    If the ratio output\/input is constant    If each output is double the previous one          A table can represent direct variation if the ratio output\/input is constant       The graphs of these two functions are shown below.  graphs of gas price and population growth  We see that the price, , of a fill-up is a linear function of the number of gallons, , purchased. This should not be surprising if we write an equation relating the variables and . Because the ratio of their values is constant, we can write where is a constant. In this example, the constant is , the price of gasoline per gallon. Solving for in terms of , we have which we recognize as the equation of a line through the origin.  In general, we make the following definition.  Direct Variation direct variation  varies directly with if where is a positive constant called the constant of variation constant of variation .  From the preceding discussion, we see that vary directly means exactly the same thing as are directly proportional . The two phrases are interchangeable.   The circumference, , of a circle varies directly with its radius, , because The constant of variation is , or about 6.28.  The amount of interest, , earned in one year on an account paying 7% simple interest, varies directly with the principal, , invested, because   Direct variation defines a linear function of the form The positive constant in the equation is just the slope of the graph, so it tells us how rapidly the graph increases. Compared to the standard form for a linear function, , the constant term, , is zero, so the graph of a direct variation passes through the origin.  Practice 1  graphs of three lines    Which of the graphs above could represent direct variation? Explain why.    (a) The graph is a straight line that increases.    (b) The graph is a straight line through the origin.    (c) The graph is a straight line that decreases.    None of the above          (b): The graph is a straight line through the origin.       QuickCheck 2   If \\(y\\) varies directly with \\(x\\), what does the constant of variation tell us?    The -intercept of the graph    The slope of the graph    What happens to when you double    The size of the input values          If \\(y\\) varies directly with \\(x\\), the constant of variation is the slope of the graph        The Scaling Property of Direct Variation  The fact that the constant term is zero in a direct variation is significant: If we double the value of , then the value of will double also. In fact, increasing by any factor causes to increase by the same factor. For example, in the table of gasoline prices, doubling the number of gallons of gas purchased, say, from gallons to gallons or from gallons to gallons, causes the total price to double also.  Or, consider investing $ for one year at 7% simple interest, as in b. The interest earned is If we increase the investment by a factor of to , or $ , the interest will be You can check that multiplying the original interest of $ by a factor of does give the same figure for the new interest, $ .   Tuition at Woodrow University is $400 plus $30 per unit. Is the tuition proportional to the number of units you take?  Imogen makes a 15% commission on her sales of environmentally friendly products marketed by her co-op. Do her earnings vary directly with her sales?    Let represent the number of units you take, and let represent your tuition. Then Thus, is a linear function of , but the -intercept is , not . Your tuition is not proportional to the number of units you take, so this is not an example of direct variation. You can check that doubling the number of units does not double the tuition. For example, and Tuition for units is not double the tuition for units. The graph of in figure (a) does not pass through the origin.  calculator graphs of two linear functions  Let represent Imogen’s sales, and let represent her commission. Then Thus, is a linear function of with a -intercept of zero, so Imogen's earnings do vary directly with her sales. This is an example of direct variation. (See figure (b).)   QuickCheck 3   What does the scaling property of direct variation mean?    The output is found by scaling the input.    The output can be regarded as a scale.    The constant of variation can be multiplied by any factor.    If we multiply the input by , the output will also be multiplied by .          If we multiply the input by the output will also be multiplied by       Practice 2   Which tables could represent direct variation? Explain why. (Hint: What happens to if you multiply by a constant?)                                                               (a) If we multiply by , is also multiplied by .    (b) If we increase , we also increase .    None of the above          (a): If we multiply by  is also multiplied by        Finding a Formula for Direct Variation  If we know any one pair of values for the variables in a direct variation, we can find the constant of variation. We can then use the constant to write a formula for one of the variables as a function of the other.  If an object is dropped from a great height, its speed, , varies directly with the time, , the object has been falling. A rock dropped off the rim of the Grand Canyon is falling at a speed of meters per second when it passes a lizard on a ledge seconds later.  Express as a function of .  What is the speed of the rock after it has fallen for 6 seconds?  Sketch a graph of versus .    Because varies directly with , there is a positive constant for which . We substitute when and solve for to find Thus, .  We evaluate the function found in part (a) for . At seconds, the rock is falling at a speed of meters per second.  You can use your calculator to graph the function . The graph is shown below.  GC graph   QuickCheck 4   Is the function an example of direct variation?    (A) Yes, it is linear.    (B) Yes, the scale factor is 0.3.    (C) No, the graph does not pass through the origin.    (D) No, its slope is less than 1.          No, the graph does not pass through the origin.       Practice 3   The volume of a bag of rice, in cups, is directly proportional to the weight of the bag. A 2-pound bag contains 3.5 cups of rice.   Express the volume, of a bag of rice as a function of its weight,     How many cups of rice are in a -pound bag?                             Direct Variation with a Power of  We can generalize the notion of direct variation to include situations in which is proportional to a power of , instead of itself.  Direct Variation with a Power direct variation with a power   varies directly varies directly with a power of if where and are positive constants.   The surface area of a sphere varies directly with the square of its radius. A balloon of radius centimeters has surface area square centimeters, or about square centimeters. Find a formula for the surface area of a sphere as a function of its radius.  If stands for the surface area of a sphere of radius , then To find the constant of variation, , we substitute the values of and . Thus, .  Practice 4   The volume of a sphere varies directly with the cube of its radius. A balloon of radius 5 centimeters has volume cubic centimeters, or about 524 cubic centimeters. Find a formula for the volume, of a sphere as a function of its radius,         and solving for we find that so       In any example of direct variation, as the input variable increases through positive values, the output variable increases also. Thus, a direct variation is an increasing function, as we can see when we consider the graphs of some typical direct variations shown below.  graphs of three variation with power  The graph of a direct variation always passes through the origin, so when the input is zero, the output is also zero. Thus, the functions and , for example, are not direct variation, even though they are increasing functions for positive .  Even without an equation, we can check whether a table of data describes direct variation or merely an increasing function. If varies directly with , then , or, equivalently, .

What should he calculate?                  If varies directly with , then , or . Delbert should calculate the ratio for each data point.                         Because the ratio is not constant, does not vary directly with .  QuickCheck 5   How can you test whether a table for represents direct variation with a power?    Plot the points.    Check whether is a constant.    Check whether is a constant.    Check whether is a constant.          Check whether is a constant.       Practice 5   Does vary directly with the cube of Explain your decision.                             Yes, is constant.    No, is not .          Yes, is constant.        Scaling scaling  Recall that if varies directly with , then doubling causes to double also. But:  Is the area of a -inch circular pizza double the area of an -inch pizza?  If you double the dimensions of a model of a skyscraper, will its weight double also?    You probably know that the answer to both of these questions is No . The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius, and the volume (and hence the weight) of an object is proportional to the cube of its linear dimension. Variation with a power of produces a different scaling effect.  The Taipei 101 building is 1671 feet tall, and in 2006 it was the tallest skyscraper in the world. Show that doubling the dimensions of a model of the Taipei 101 building produces a model that weighs times as much.  The Taipei 101 skyscraper is approximately box shaped, so its volume is given by the product of its linear dimensions, . The weight of an object is proportional to its volume, so the weight, , of the model is where the constant depends on the material of the model. If we double the length, width, and height of the model, then The weight of the new model is times the weight of the original model.  Practice 6   Use the formula for the area of a circle to show that doubling the diameter of a pizza quadruples its area.  The formula for the area of a circle of radius is  If we double the diameter, the new radius is  Substitute this expression into the area formula to get the area of the new circle  So is times the original area.                        Doubling the diameter means doubling the radius.        In general, if varies directly with a power of , that is, if , then doubling the value of causes to increase by a factor of . In fact, if we multiply by any positive number , then so the value of is multiplied by .  We will call the scaling exponent scaling exponent , and you will often see variation described in terms of scaling. For example, we might say that \"the area of a circle scales as the square of its radius.\" (In many applications, the power is called the scale factor , even though it is not a factor but an exponent.)   Inverse Variation inverse variation  How long does it take to travel a distance of miles? The answer depends on your average speed. If you are on a bicycle trip, your average speed might be miles per hour. In that case, your traveling time will be (Of course, you will have to add time for rest stops; the hours are just your travel time.)  If you are driving your car, you might average miles per hour. Your travel time is then  If you take a commercial air flight, the plane’s speed might be miles per hour, and the flight time would be  You can see that for higher average speeds, the travel time is shorter. In other words, the time needed for a -mile journey is a decreasing function of average speed. In fact, a formula for the function is  This function is an example of inverse variation inverse variation .

Inverse variation describes a decreasing function, but not every decreasing function represents inverse variation. People sometimes mistakenly use the phrase varies inversely to describe any decreasing function, but if varies inversely with , the variables must satisfy an equation of the form , or .  To decide whether two variables truly vary inversely, we can check whether their product is constant. For instance, in the preceding travel-time example, we see from the table that .                            QuickCheck 6   How can you test whether a table for represents inverse variation?    Check whether is a constant.    Check whether the function is decreasing.    Check whether is the reciprocal of .    Check whether is a constant.          Check whether is a constant.

We may also say that is inversely proportional inversely proportional to .  The weight, , of an object varies inversely with the square of its distance, , from the center of the Earth. Thus, If you double your distance from the center of the Earth, what happens to your weight? What if you triple the distance?  Suppose you weigh pounds at distance from the center of the Earth. Then . At distance , your weight will be Your new weight will be of your old weight. By a similar calculation, you can check that by tripling the distance, your weight will be reduced to of its original value.

  "body": " Integer Exponents  Recall that a positive integer exponent tells us how many times its base occurs as a factor in an expression. For example,  Negative Exponents negative exponents  Study the list of powers of shown in Table (a) and observe the pattern as we move up the list from bottom to top. Each time the exponent increases by 1 we multiply by another factor of . We can continue up the list as far as we like.   a.  If we move back down the list, we divide by at each step, until we get to the bottom of the list, . What if we continue the list in the same way, dividing by each time we decrease the exponent? The results are shown in Table (b).  As we continue to divide by , we generate fractions whose denominators are powers of . In particular,  table of integer exponents  b.   Based on these observations, we make the following definitions.  Definition of Negative and Zero Exponents   These definitions tell us that if the base is not zero, then any number raised to the zero power is , and that a negative exponent denotes a reciprocal.       A negative exponent does not mean that the power is negative! For example,  In b, note that The exponent, , applies only to the base , not to .   QuickCheck 1   Which of these is equivalent to                      is equivalent to       Practice 1   Write each expression without using negative exponents.                                 In the next example, we see how to evaluate expressions that contain negative exponents and how to solve equations involving negative exponents.  The body mass index, or BMI, is one measure of a person’s physical fitness. Your body mass index is defined by where is your weight in kilograms and is your height in meters. The World Health Organization classifies a person as obese if his or her BMI is or higher.  Calculate the BMI for a woman who is meters ( inches) tall and weighs kilograms ( pounds).  For a fixed weight, how does BMI vary with height?  The world’s heaviest athlete is the amateur sumo wrestler Emanuel Yarbrough, who weighs kg ( pounds). What height would Yarbrough have to be to have a BMI under ?      , so BMI varies inversely with the square of height. That is, for a fixed weight, BMI decreases as height increases.  To find the height that gives a BMI of , we solve the equation . Note that the variable appears in the denominator of a fraction, so we begin by clearing the denominator—in this case we multiply both sides of the equation by . To have a BMI under , Yarbrough would have to be over meters, or feet inches tall. (In fact, he is feet inches tall.)   Practice 2   Solve the equation                   Pause and Reflect   Explain why if        Power Functions  The functions that describe direct and inverse variation are part of a larger family of functions called power functions .  Power Function  A function of the form where and are nonzero constants, is called a power function power function .  Examples of power functions are In addition, the basic functions which we studied in can be written as Their graphs are shown below. Note that the domains of power functions with negative exponents do not include zero.  graphs of the two basic reciprocal functions  Which of the following are power functions?       This is not a power function, because of the addition of the constant term.  We can write , so is a power function.  This is not a power function, but it can be treated as the sum of two power functions, because .   Practice 3   Write each function as a power function in the form  For this exercise, enter rational numbers in decimal form. For example, enter 0.5 rather than 1\/2 .                                             QuickCheck 2   Which statement is true about power functions?    They can describe direct or inverse variation.    They involve a power of the output variable.    The -intercept must be a positive number.    They include all linear and quadratic functions.          They can describe direct or inverse variation.       Most applications are concerned with positive variables only, so many models use only the portion of the graph in the first quadrant.  In the Middle Ages in Europe, castles were built as defensive strongholds. An attacking force would build a huge catapult called a trebuchet to hurl rocks and scrap metal inside the castle walls. The engineers could adjust its range by varying the mass of the projectiles. The mass, , of the projectile should be inversely proportional to the square of the distance, , to the target.  Use a negative exponent to write as a function of , .  The engineers test the trebuchet with a -kilogram projectile, which lands meters away. Find the constant of proportionality; then rewrite your formula for .  Graph .  The trebuchet is meters from the courtyard within the castle. What size projectile will hit the target?  The attacking force would like to hurl a -kilogram projectile at the castle. How close must the attackers bring their trebuchet?    If we use for the constant of proportionality, then . Rewriting this equation with a negative exponent gives .  We substitute and to obtain Thus, .  We evaluate the function for several values of , or use a calculator to obtain the graph below.  graph of mass vs distance  We substitute into the formula: The attackers should use a mass of approximately kilograms.  We substitute into the formula and solve for . They must locate the trebuchet meters from the castle.   The function is an example of an inverse square law inverse square law , because varies inversely with the square of . Such laws are fairly common in physics and its applications, because gravitational and other forces behave in this way. Here is a more modern example of an inverse square law.  Practice 4   Cell phone towers typically transmit signals at 10 watts of power. The signal strength varies inversely with the square of distance from the tower, and 1 kilometer away the signal strength is 0.8 picowatt. (A picowatt is watt.) Cell phones can receive a signal as small as 0.01 picowatt. How far can you be from the nearest tower and still hope to have cell phone reception?  About km        About 9 km       Pause and Reflect   What is an inverse square law? Give an example.        Working with Negative Exponents  A negative exponent denotes the reciprocal of a power. Thus, to simplify a fraction with a negative exponent, we compute the positive power of its reciprocal.      Practice 5   Simplify              Dividing by a power with a negative exponent is equivalent to multiplying by a power with a positive exponent.      Practice 6   Write each expression without using negative exponents.                                  Laws of Exponents laws of exponents  The laws of exponents apply to all integer exponents, positive, negative, and zero. When we allow negative exponents, we can simplify the rule for computing quotients of powers.  Quotient of Powers II.   For example, by applying this new version of the law for quotients, we find which is consistent with our previous version of the rule,  QuickCheck 3   Which of these is equivalent to                            For reference, we restate the laws of exponents below. The laws are valid for all integer exponents and , and for .  Laws of Exponents  laws of exponents             You can check that each of the calculations in is shorter when we use negative exponents instead of converting the expressions into algebraic fractions.  QuickCheck 4   Which of the following is not one of the laws of exponents?                      The equation is not one of the laws of exponents.       Practice 7   Simplify by applying the laws of exponents. Write without negative exponents.                                 The laws of exponents do not apply to sums or differences of powers. We can add or subtract like terms, that is, powers with the same exponent. For example, but we cannot add or subtract terms with different exponents . Thus, for example,  At the start of this section, we saw that , and in fact as long as . Now we can see that this definition is consistent with the laws of exponents. The quotient of any (nonzero) number divided by itself is . But by applying the second law of exponents, we also have  Thus,  Zero as Exponent    For example,  Pause and Reflect   Give a numerical example to show why we cannot add or subtract terms with the same variable but different exponents.

The f-stop setting on a camera regulates the size of the aperture and thus the amount of light entering the camera. The f-stop is inversely proportional to the diameter, , of the aperture.  Use the data and the graph to find the constant of proportionality and write as a power function of . Values of have been rounded to one decimal place.                      power function   Why are the f-stop settings labeled with the values given in the table?    As you stop down the aperture from one f-value to the next, by what factor does increase?  The Stefan-Boltzmann law relates the total amount of radiation emitted by a star to its temperature, , in kelvins, by the following formula: where is the radius of the star, is its luminosity, and is a constant governing radiation. (See Algebra Skills Refresher to review scientific notation.)  Write a formula for luminosity as a power function of temperature for a fixed radius.  The radius of the Sun is meters, and its luminosity is watts. Calculate the temperature of the Sun.     K   Poiseuille's law for the flow of liquid through a tube can be used to describe blood flow through an artery. The rate of flow, , in liters per minute is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, , divided by the length, , of the artery.  Write a formula for the rate of flow as a power function of radius.  If the radius and length of the artery are measured in centimeters, then the constant of variation, , is determined by blood pressure and viscosity. If a certain artery is centimeters long, what should its radius be in order to allow a blood flow of liters per minute?    Airplanes use radar to detect the distances to other objects. A radar unit transmits a pulse of energy, which bounces off a distant object, and the echo of the pulse returns to the sender. The power, , of the returning echo is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance, , to the object. A radar operator receives an echo of watts from an aircraft nautical miles away.  Express the power of the echo received in picowatts. ( picowatt watts.)  Write a function that expresses in terms of d using negative exponents. Use picowatts for the units of power.  Complete the table of values for the power of the echo received from objects at various distances.

Use units of picowatts on the vertical axis.   Convert watts to picowatts.  picowatts      (nautical miles)        (picowatts)         nautical miles  inverse-square   The lifetime of a star is roughly inversely proportional to the cube of its mass. Our Sun, which has a mass of one solar mass, will last for approximately billion years.  Write a power function for the lifetime, , of a star in terms of its mass, .  Sketch a graph of the function using units of solar mass on the horizontal axis.  How long will a star that is times as massive as the Sun last?  One solar mass is about kilograms. Rewrite your formula for with the units of mass in kilograms.  How long will a star that is half as massive as the Sun last?    The amount of force or thrust generated by the propeller of a ship is a function of two variables: the diameter of the propeller and its speed, in rotations per minute. The thrust, , in pounds, is proportional to the square of the speed, , and the fourth power of the diameter, , in feet.  Write a formula for the thrust in terms of the speed if the diameter of the propeller is feet.  A propeller of diameter feet generates a thrust of pounds at rotations per minute. Find the constant of variation in the formula for thrust.  Sketch a graph of the thrust as a function of the propeller speed for a propellor of diameter feet.

The World Health Organization classifies a person as obese if his or her BMI is or higher.  Calculate the BMI for a woman who is meters ( inches) tall and weighs kilograms ( pounds).  For a fixed weight, how does BMI vary with height?  The world’s heaviest athlete is the amateur sumo wrestler Emanuel Yarbrough, who weighs kg ( pounds). What height would Yarbrough have to be to have a BMI under ?      , so BMI varies inversely with the square of height. That is, for a fixed weight, BMI decreases as height increases.  To find the height that gives a BMI of , we solve the equation . Note that the variable appears in the denominator of a fraction, so we begin by clearing the denominator—in this case we multiply both sides of the equation by . To have a BMI under , Yarbrough would have to be over meters, or feet inches tall. (In fact, he is feet inches tall.)  "

Exponential Notation for Radicals  A convenient notation for radicals uses fractional exponents. Consider the expression . What meaning can we attach to an exponent that is a fraction? The third law of exponents says that when we raise a power to a power, we multiply the exponents together: Therefore, if we square the number , we get Thus, is a number whose square is . But this means that is a square root of , or In general, any nonnegative number raised to the power is equal to the positive square root of the number, or     is not a real number.    Practice 2   Evaluate each power.                                                       The same reasoning works for roots with any index.

For example,  QuickCheck 1   Which of the following expressions is not equivalent to the other three?                      is not equivalent to the other three expressions.

These are examples of irrational numbers irrational numbers . We can use a calculator to obtain decimal approximations for irrational numbers. For example, you can verify that It is not possible to write down an exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number, but we can find an approximation to as many decimal places as we like.  The following keying sequence for evaluating the irrational number is incorrect:  7 ^ 1 ÷ 5 ENTER  You can check that this sequence calculates , instead of . Recall that according to the order of operations, powers are computed before multiplications or divisions. We must enclose the exponent in parentheses and enter  7 ^ ( 1 ÷ 5 ) ENTER   Or, because , we can enter  7 ^ 0.2 ENTER   Working with Fractional Exponents  Fractional exponents simplify many calculations involving radicals. You should learn to convert easily between exponential and radical notation. Remember that a negative exponent denotes a reciprocal.  Convert each radical to exponential notation.     Practice 5   Convert each radical to exponential notation.                                  Convert each power to radical notation.       In d, note that the exponent applies only to , not to .

QuickCheck 2   Which of the following statements is true?                             Using Fractional Exponents to Solve Equations  In Chapter 2, we learned that raising to powers and taking roots are inverse operations, that is, each operation undoes the effects of the other. This relationship is especially easy to see when the root is denoted by a fractional exponent. For example, to solve the equation we would take the fourth root of each side. But instead of using radical notation, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power : The third law of exponents tells us that , so In general, to solve an equation involving a power function , we first isolate the power, then raise both sides to the exponent .  For astronomers, the mass of a star is its most important property, but it is also the most difficult to measure directly. For many stars, their luminosity, or brightness, varies roughly as the fourth power of the mass.  Our Sun has luminosity watts and mass kilograms. Because the numbers involved are so large, astronomers often use these solar constants as units of measure: The luminosity of the Sun is solar luminosity, and its mass is solar mass. Write a power function for the luminosity, , of a star in terms of its mass, , using units of solar mass and solar luminosity.  The star Sirius is times brighter than the Sun, so its luminosity is solar luminosities. Estimate the mass of Sirius in units of solar mass.    Because varies as the fourth power of , we have Substituting the values of and for the Sun (namely, and ), we find so and .  We substitute the luminosity of Sirius, , to get To solve the equation for , we raise both sides to the power. The mass of Sirius is about solar masses, or about times the mass of the Sun.   Practice 7   A spherical fish tank in the lobby of the Atlantis Hotel holds about 905 cubic feet of water. What is the radius of the fish tank?  Answer: About feet        Solve to find that the radius is about feet        Power Functions  The basic functions and are power functions of the form , and the graphs of all such functions have shapes similar to those two, depending on whether the index of the root is even or odd.  Figure (a) shows the graphs of Figure (b) shows the graphs of  graphs of roots  We cannot take an even root of a negative number. (See at the end of this section.) Hence, if is even, the domain of is restricted to nonnegative real numbers, but if is odd, the domain of is the set of all real numbers.  We will also encounter power functions with negative exponents. For example, an animal's heart rate is related to its size or mass, with smaller animals generally having faster heart rates. The heart rates of mammals are given approximately by the power function where is the animal's mass and is a constant.  A typical human male weighs about kilograms and has a resting heart rate of beats per minute.  Find the constant of proportionality, , and write a formula for .  Fill in the table with the heart rates of the mammals whose masses are given.

The study of the relationship between the growth rates of different parts of an organism, or of organisms of similar type, is called allometry allometry . An equation of the form used to describe such a relationship is called an allometric equation allometric equation .  Of course, power functions can be expressed using any of the notations we have discussed.

The radical may be denoted by a fractional exponent. For example, the equation is a radical equation because . To solve the equation, we first isolate the power to get Then we raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal of , or .  When a car brakes suddenly, its speed can be estimated from the length of the skid marks it leaves on the pavement. A formula for the car’s speed, in miles per hour, is , where the length of the skid marks, , is given in feet.  If a car leaves skid marks feet long, how fast was the car traveling when the driver applied the brakes?  How far will a car skid if its driver applies the brakes while traveling miles per hour?    To find the velocity of the car, we evaluate the function for . The car was traveling at approximately miles per hour.  We would like to find the value of when the value of is known. We substitute into the formula and solve the equation Because appears to the power , we first square both sides of the equation to get You can check that this value for works in the original equation. Thus, the car will skid approximately feet. A graph of the function is shown below, along with the points corresponding to the values in parts (a) and (b).  velocity vs braking distance   QuickCheck 4   Which law of exponents do we use when solving                            Thus, we can solve an equation where one side is an th root of by raising both sides of the equation to the th power. We must be careful when raising both sides of an equation to an even power, since extraneous solutions may be introduced. However, because most applications of power functions deal with positive domains only, they do not usually involve extraneous solutions.  Practice 9  In , we found the heart-rate function, .

Answer: kg        We solve to find kg        A Note on Roots of Negative Numbers  You already know that is not a real number, because there is no real number whose square is . Similarly, is not a real number, because there is no real number for which . (Both of these radicals are complex numbers complex number . Complex numbers are discussed in Chapter 7.) In general, we cannot find an even root (square root, fourth root, and so on) of a negative number.  On the other hand, every positive number has two even roots that are real numbers. For example, both and are square roots of . The symbol refers only to the positive, or principal root , of . If we want to refer to the negative square root of , we must write . Similarly, both and are fourth roots of , because and . However, the symbol refers to the principal, or positive, fourth root only. Thus,  Things are simpler for odd roots (cube roots, fifth roots, and so on). Every real number, whether positive, negative, or zero, has exactly one real-valued odd root. For example,  Here is a summary of our discussion.  Roots of Real Numbers  Every positive number has two real-valued roots, one positive and one negative, if the index is even.  A negative number has no real-valued root if the index is even.  Every real number, positive, negative, or zero, has exactly one real-valued root if the index is odd.    is not a real number.    is not a real number.   The same principles apply to powers with fractional exponents. Thus but is not a real number.

What about other fractional exponents? What meaning can we attach to a power of the form ?  Consider the power . Notice that the exponent , and thus by the third law of exponents, we can write In other words, we can compute by first taking the square root of and then cubing the result. For example, We will define fractional powers only when the base is a positive number.

If , the graph is concave up. If , the graph is concave down. Some examples are shown below.  power functions  Perhaps the single most useful piece of information a scientist can have about an animal is its metabolic rate. The metabolic rate is the amount of energy the animal uses per unit of time for its usual activities, including locomotion, growth, and reproduction. The basal metabolic rate, or BMR, sometimes called the resting metabolic rate, is the minimum amount of energy the animal can expend in order to survive.  A revised form of Kleiber's rule states that the basal metabolic rate for many groups of animals is given by where is the mass of the animal in kilograms and the BMR is measured in kilocalories per day.  Calculate the BMR for various animals whose masses are given in the table.    Animal  Bat  Squirrel  Raccoon  Lynx  Human  Moose  Rhinoceros    Weight (kg)          BMR (kcal\/day)          Sketch a graph of Kleiber’s rule for .  Do larger species eat more or less, relative to their body mass, than smaller ones?    We evaluate the function for the values of given. For example, to calculate the BMR of a bat, we compute A bat expends, and hence must consume, at least kilocalories per day. We evaluate the function to complete the rest of the table.    Animal  Bat  Squirrel  Raccoon  Lynx  Human  Moose  Rhinoceros   Weight (kg)          BMR (kcal\/day)          We plot the data from the table to obtain the graph below.  BMR vs mass  If energy consumption were proportional to body weight, the graph would be a straight line. But because the exponent in Kleiber’s rule, , is less than , the graph is concave down, or bends downward. Therefore, larger species eat less than smaller ones, relative to their body weight.   Practice 2     Complete the table of values for the function                                              Sketch the graph of the function.

It is concave up if , and concave down if .          The graph is concave up if and concave down if        More about Scaling  In we saw that large animals eat less than smaller ones, relative to their body weight. This is because the scaling exponent in Kleiber's rule is less than . For example, let represent the mass of a squirrel. The mass of a moose is then , and its metabolic rate is or times the metabolic rate of the squirrel. Metabolic rate scales as , compared to the mass of the animal.  In a famous experiment in the 1960s, an elephant was given LSD. The dose was determined from a previous experiment in which a -kg cat was given gram of LSD. Because the elephant weighed kg, the experimenters used a direct proportion to calculate the dose for the elephant: and arrived at the figure g of LSD. Unfortunately, the elephant did not survive the experiment.  Use Kleiber's rule and the dosage for a cat to estimate the corresponding dose for an elephant.  If the experimenters had taken into account the scaling exponent of in metabolic rate, they would have used a smaller dose. Because the elephant weighs , or about times as much as the cat, the dose would be times the dosage for a cat, or about grams.  Practice 3   A human being weighs about kg, and mg of LSD is enough to induce severe psychotic symptoms. Use these data and Kleiber s rule to predict what dosage would produce a similar effect in an elephant.  About mg        About mg        Radical Notation radical notation  Because , we can write any power with a fractional exponent in radical form as follows.  Rational Exponents and Radicals         Practice 4   Write each expression in radical notation.                                                             QuickCheck 3   The notation means                            Usually, we will want to convert from radical notation to fractional exponents, since exponential notation is easier to use.        Practice 5   Convert to exponential notation.                                   Operations with Rational Exponents  Powers with rational exponents—positive, negative, or zero—obey the laws of exponents, which we discussed in . You may want to review those laws before studying the following examples.            Practice 6   Simplify by applying the laws of exponents.                                   QuickCheck 4   Which of the following is the correct way to evaluate on a calculator?                             Solving Equations  According to the third law of exponents, when we raise a power to another power, we multiply the exponents together. In particular, if the two exponents are reciprocals, then their product is . For example, This observation can help us to solve equations involving fractional exponents. For instance, to solve the equation we raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal power, . This gives us The solution is .  Solve  We raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal power, .  QuickCheck 5   To solve the equation we should    A) Raise both sides to the negative of the exponent    B) Divide both sides by the exponent    C) Raise both sides to the reciprocal of the exponent    D) Raise the right side to the given exponent          Raise both sides to the reciprocal of the exponent       Practice 7   Solve the equation Round your answer to two decimal places.  Answer:                 Pause and Reflect   Explain why       Vampire Bats  Small animals such as bats cannot survive for long without eating. The graph below shows how the weight, , of a typical vampire bat decreases over time until its next meal, until the bat reaches the point of starvation.

Suppose a bat that weighs grams consumes grams of blood. How many hours of life does it gain? Suppose a bat that weighs grams gives up a meal of grams of blood. How many hours of life does it forfeit?  Vampire bats sometimes donate blood (through regurgitation) to other bats that are close to starvation. Suppose a bat at point on the curve donates grams of blood to a bat at point . Explain why this strategy is effective for the survival of the bat community.

  "body": " Joint Variation  Functions of Two or More Variables  So far, we have studied functions that relate values of an output variable to values of a single input variable. But it is not uncommon for an output variable to depend on two or more inputs. Many familiar formulas describe functions of several variables.  For example, the perimeter of a rectangle depends on its length and width. The volume of a cylinder depends on its radius and height. The distance you travel depends on your speed and the time you spent traveling. Each of these formulas can be written with function notation.  The cost, , of driving a rental car is given by the function where is the number of days you rent the car and is the number of gallons of gas you buy.  Evaluate and explain what it means.  You have $100 to rent a car for days. How much gas can you buy?    We substitute for and for to find It will cost $ to rent a car for days and buy gallons of gas.  We would like to find the value of when and . That is, we want to solve the equation You can buy gallons of gas.   QuickCheck 1   Which is true about a function of two variables?    A) It has one input and two outputs.    B) It has two inputs and one output.    C) It has two inputs and two outputs.    D) None of the above.          A function of two variables has two inputs and one output.       Practice 1   The maximum height that the water stream from a fire hose can reach depends on the water pressure and the diameter of the nozzle, and is given by the function   where is the nozzle pressure in psi, and is measured in -inch increments over the standard nozzle diameter of inch.    Evaluate and explain what it means.     With nozzle pressure of 40 psi and nozzle diameter of 2 in., the water will reach 61 feet.    With nozzle pressure of 40 psi and nozzle diameter of inch, the water will reach 61 feet.    With nozzle pressure of 40 psi and nozzle diameter of inch, the water will reach 61 feet.    With nozzle pressure of 40 psi and nozzle diameter of 1 inch, the water will reach 61 feet.    With nozzle pressure of 40 psi and nozzle diameter of inch, the water will reach 61 feet.      What nozzle pressure is needed to reach a height of feet with a -inch nozzle?    psi    in    ft                             With nozzle diameter inch and nozzle pressure psi, the water will reach feet.    The -inch nozzle is three increments over the standard nozzle diameter of inch. We solve for when and  psi          Tables of Values  Just as for functions of a single variable, we can use tables to describe functions of two variables, . The row and column headings show the values of the two input variables, and the table entries show the values of the output variable.  Windchill is a function of two variables, temperature and wind speed, or . The table shows the windchill factor for various combinations of temperature and wind speed.     Windchill Factors     Temperature ( F)   Wind speed (mph)                                                              What is the windchill factor when the temperature is F and the wind is blowing at mph? Write this fact with function notation.  Find a value for so that . What does this equation tell you about the windchill factor?  Solve the equation . What does this tell you about the windchill factor?    We look in the row for mph and the column for . The associated windchill factor is , so .  We look in the row for until we find the windchill factor of . The column heading for that entry is , so . When the wind speed is mph and the windchill factor is , the temperature is F.  In the F column, we find the windchill factor of in the -mph row, so . The wind speed is mph when the temperature is F and the windchill factor is .

A) If you contribute 2500 dollars per year for 20 years, you will accumulate 137,286 dollars.    B) If you contribute 137 dollars per year for 286 years, you will accumulate 20 dollars.                                                           $129,528,    $1000,    20 years. If you contribute $2500 per year for 20 years, you will accumulate $137,286.          Joint Variation joint variation  Sometimes we can find patterns relating the entries in a table.  Rectangular beams of a given length can support a load, , that depends on both the width and the depth of the beam, so that . The table shows some of the values.     Maximum Load (kilograms)    Depth (cm)   Width (cm)                                                         Evaluate the function at . What does your answer tell you about beams?  Is it true that ?  Consider the row corresponding to a width of cm. How does the load depend on the depth?    In the row for cm and the column for cm, we find that . A beam of width cm and depth cm can support a maximum load of kilograms.  In the row for cm and the column for cm, we find that , so .  Using the row for width cm, we make a new table showing the relationship between load and depth. The increase in load for each increase of cm in depth is not a constant, so the graph shown below is not a straight line.  The curve does pass through the origin, so perhaps the data describe direct variation with a power of depth. If we try the equation and use the point , we find that , so . You can check that the equation does fit the rest of the data points.

In fact, the load varies directly with width for any fixed depth.  In , we saw that the load varies with the square of depth when the width is centimeters, and this relationship also holds for any value of . Consequently, we can find a constant such that This relationship between variables is an example of joint variation joint variation .  Joint Variation  We say that  varies jointly varies jointly with and if   We say that varies directly with and inversely with if    QuickCheck 2   Which of the following functions represents joint variation, where is a constant?                            Find a formula for load as a function of width and depth for the data in .  The function we want has the form for some value of . We use the fact that when and . Then so . The formula for load as a function of width and depth is You can check that this formula works for all the values in the table.

Instead, we will represent such functions graphically by holding one of the two variables constant.  In , we found a formula for the load a beam can support,   Graph as a function of for and .  Graph as a function of for and .    We make four graphs on the same grid, one for each value of : The graphs are shown at left below. We can see that varies directly with the width of the beam for any fixed value of its depth.   graphs of load vs width  graphs of load vs depth   We make one graph for each value of : The graphs are shown at right above. For any fixed value of its width, varies directly with the square of depth.   QuickCheck 3   We can represent a function of two variables by    a table of values.    a graph in three dimensions.    several graphs in two dimensions.    all of the above.          all of the above.

The table shows values of , where is the thickness of the insulation and is the area of the ceiling.     Cost of Insulation (dollars)     Area (sq m)    Thickness (cm)                                                                 What does it cost to insulate a ceiling with an area of square meters with cm of insulation? Write your answer in function notation.  Solve the equation and interpret your answer.  Consider the row corresponding to a thickness of cm. How does the cost of insulating the ceiling depend on the area of the ceiling?  Consider the column corresponding to an area of square meters. How does the cost depend on the thickness of the insulation?  Given that the cost varies jointly with the thickness of the insulation and the area of the ceiling, write an equation for cost as a function of area and thickness of insulation.  Use your formula from part (e) to determine the cost of insulating a building with centimeters of insulation if the area of the ceiling is square meters.    $  : It costs $ to insulate a ceiling with cm of insulation over an area of square meters.     $   The volume, , of a quantity of helium depends on both the temperature and the pressure of the gas. The table shows values of for temperature in kelvins and pressure in atmospheres.     Volume (cubic meters)     Temperature (K)    Pressure (atmospheres)                                               What is the volume of helium when the pressure is atmospheres and the temperature is K? Write your answer in function notation.  Solve the equation and interpret your answer.  Consider the row corresponding to atmospheres. How is the volume related to the absolute temperature?  Consider the column corresponding to K. How is the volume related to the pressure?  Given that the volume of the gas varies directly with temperature and inversely with pressure, write an equation for volume as a function of temperature and pressure.  Use your formula from part (e) to determine the volume of the helium at K and pressure of atmospheres.    In his hiking guidebook, Afoot and Afield in Los Angeles County , Jerry Schad notes that the number of people on a wilderness trail is inversely proportional to \"the square of the distance and the cube of the elevation gain from the nearest road.\"  Choose variables and write a formula for this relationship.  On a sunny Saturday afternoon, you count people enjoying the Rock Pool at Malibu Creek State Park. The Rock Pool is miles from the main parking lot, and the trail includes an elevation gain of feet. Calculate the constant of variation in your formula from part (a).  Hint: Convert the elevation gain to miles.  Lookout Trail leads miles from the parking lot and involves an elevation gain of feet. How many people would you expect to encounter at the end of the trail?    , where is number of people, is distance in miles from the road, is the elevation gain, and is the constant of variation.     A company's monthly production, , depends on the capital, , the company has invested and the amount of labor, , available each month. The Cobb-Douglas model for production assumes that varies jointly with and , where and are positive constants less than . The Aztech Chip Company invested units of capital and hired workers and produces computer chips each month.  Suppose that , . Find the constant of variation and a formula giving in terms of and .  If Aztech increases its labor force to workers, what production level can they expect?  If Aztech maintains its labor force at workers, what amount of capital outlay would be required for monthly production to reach computer chips?       "

  "body": " Exponential Functions  Introduction In , we studied functions that describe exponential growth or decay. More formally, we define an exponential function as follows.  Exponential Function     Some examples of exponential functions are The constant is the -intercept of the graph because For the examples above, we find that the -intercepts are  The positive constant is called the base of the exponential function.  QuickCheck 1   Which of the following is an exponential function?                             We do not allow to be negative, because if , then is not a real number for some values of . For example, if and , then is an imaginary number.  We also exclude as a base because for all values of ; hence the function is actually the constant function .    Graphs of Exponential Functions  The graphs of exponential functions have two characteristic shapes, depending on whether the base, , is greater than or less than . As typical examples, consider the graphs of and shown below. Some values for and are recorded in the tables.                                                       graphs of exponential growth and decay  Notice that is an increasing function and is a decreasing function. Both are concave up. In general, exponential functions have the following properties.  Properties of Exponential Functions, ,   Domain: all real numbers.  Range: all positive numbers.  If , the function is increasing and concave up;  if , the function is decreasing and concave up.  The -intercept is . There is no -intercept.   In the table for , you can see that as the -values decrease toward negative infinity, the corresponding -values decrease toward zero. As a result, the graph of decreases toward the -axis as we move to the left. Thus, the negative -axis is a horizontal asymptote for exponential functions with , as shown in figure (a).  For exponential functions with , the positive -axis is an asymptote, as illustrated in figure (b). (See to review asymptotes.)  QuickCheck 2   Which statement is true?    An exponential function is not defined for negative inputs.    The outputs of an exponential function cannot be negative.    The -intercept of the function is .    The function decreases by 8 each time we increase by 1.          The outputs of an exponential function cannot be negative.       In , we compare two increasing exponential functions. The larger the value of the base, , the faster the function grows. In this example, both functions have .  Compare the graphs of and .   We evaluate each function for several convenient values, as shown in the table.  Then we plot the points for each function and connect them with smooth curves. For positive -values, is always larger than , and is increasing more rapidly. In the figure, we can see that climbs more rapidly than . Both graphs cross the -axis at (0, 1).                             two exponential growth functions   For decreasing exponential functions, those with bases between and , the smaller the base, the more steeply the graph decreases. For example, compare the graphs of and shown in the figure at right.  two exponential decay functions  Practice 1     State the ranges of the functions and from the previous Example on the domain        State the ranges of the functions and shown in the Note above on the domain Round your answers to two decimal places.                                             Transformations of Exponential Functions  In , we considered transformations of the basic graphs. For instance, the graphs of the functions and are shifts of the basic parabola, . In a similar way, we can shift or stretch the graph of an exponential function while the basic shape is preserved.  Use your calculator to graph the following functions. Describe how these graphs compare with the graph of .     Enter the formulas for the three functions as shown below. Note the parentheses around the exponent in the keying sequence for   ^ X   ^ X + 3   ^  ( X + 3 )  The graphs of , , and in the standard window are shown below.  GC graphs of transformations of exponential growth   The graph of , shown in figure (b), has the same basic shape as that of , but it has a horizontal asymptote at instead of at (the -axis). In fact, , so the graph of is a vertical translation of the graph of by units. If every point on the graph of is moved units upward, the result is the graph of .  First note that . In fact, the graph of shown in figure (c) has the same basic shape as but has been translated units to the left.   QuickCheck 3   Which function translates the graph of two units to the right?                            What about reflections? Recall that the graph of is the reflection about the -axis of the graph of . The graphs of and are shown at left below.   vertical flip of an exponential function  horizontal flip of an exponential function   You may have also noticed a relationship between the graphs of and , which are shown at right above. The graph of is the reflection of the graph of about the -axis. We can see why this is true by writing the formula for in another way: We see that is the same function as . Replacing by in the formula for a function switches every point on the graph with the point and thus reflects the graph about the -axis.  Reflections of Graphs reflections of graphs  The graph of is the reflection of the graph of about the -axis.  The graph of is the reflection of the graph of about the -axis.   Practice 2   Which of the functions below have the same graph? Explain why.    (a) and (b)    (a) and (c)    (b) and (c)    None of the above                     (a) and (c) are the same function.       Pause and Reflect   How are the graphs of and related?        Comparing Exponential and Power Functions  Exponential functions exponential function are not the same as the power functions power function we studied in . Although both involve expressions with exponents, it is the location of the variable that makes the difference.  Power Functions vs Exponential Functions         Power Functions  Exponential Functions   General formula     Description  variable base and constant exponent  constant base and variable exponent   Example     These two families of functions have very different properties, as well.  Compare the power function and the exponential function .  First, compare the values for these two functions shown in the table.   The scaling exponent for is , so that when doubles, say, from to , the output is multiplied by , or .  On the other hand, we can tell that is exponential because its values increase by a factor of for each unit increase in . (To see this, divide any function value by the previous one.)                                     As you would expect, the graphs of the two functions are also quite different. For starters, note that the power function goes through the origin, while the exponential function has -intercept as shown at left below.   power function vs exponential from -2 to 3  power function vs exponential from 0 to 6   From the table, we see that , so the two graphs intersect at .

Exponential Equations  An exponential equation exponential equation is one in which the variable is part of an exponent. For example, the equation is exponential.  Many exponential equations can be solved by writing both sides of the equation as powers with the same base. To solve the equation above, we write which is true if and only if .  In general, if two equivalent powers have the same base, then their exponents must be equal also, as long as the base is not or .  Sometimes the laws of exponents can be used to express both sides of an equation as single powers of a common base.  Solve the following equations.      Using the fact that , we write each side of the equation as a power of : Now we equate the exponents to obtain  We write each factor as a power of . We use the laws of exponents to simplify each side: Now we equate the exponents to obtain The solution is .   QuickCheck 5   Which is a good strategy for solving    Divide both sides by 3.

Suppose that a colony of bacteria doubles in size every day. If the colony starts with bacteria, how long will it be before there are bacteria? We answered questions of this type in by writing and solving an exponential equation. The function gives the number of bacteria present on day , so we must solve the equation Dividing both sides by 50 yields The solution of this equation is the answer to the following question:  To what power must we raise in order to get ?  The value of that solves the equation is called the base   logarithm logarithm of . Because , the base logarithm of is . We write this as In other words, we solve an exponential equation by computing a logarithm. You can check that solves the problem stated above:  Thus, the unknown exponent is called a logarithm. In general, for positive values of and , we make the following definition.  Definition of Logarithm  For , the base logarithm of , base written , is the exponent to which must be raised in order to yield .  It will help to keep in mind that a logarithm is just an exponent.  Some logarithms, like some square roots, are easy to evaluate, while others require a calculator. We will start with the easy ones.  Compute the logarithms.        To evaluate , we ask what exponent on base will produce . Or, 3 to what power equals 9? The exponent we need is , so We use similar reasoning to compute the other logarithms.      Practice 1   Find each logarithm.                                  QuickCheck 1   A logarithm is the same as    an exponent.    a coefficient.    a quotient.    a radical.          an exponent       From the definition of a logarithm and the examples above, we see that the following two statements are equivalent.  Logarithms and Exponents: Conversion Equations  If , , and ,   In other words, the logarithm, , is the same as the exponent in . We see again that a logarithm is an exponent ; it is the exponent to which must be raised to yield .  These equations allow us to convert from logarithmic to exponential form, or vice versa. You should memorize the conversion equations, because we will use them frequently.  As special cases of the equivalence in (1), we can compute the following useful logarithms. For any base ,  Some Useful Logarithms          Practice 2   Find each logarithm.                                  QuickCheck 2   becuase                             Using the Conversion Equations  We use logarithms to solve exponential equations, just as we use square roots to solve quadratic equations. Consider the two equations We solve the first equation by taking a square root, and we solve the second equation by computing a logarithm: The operation of taking a base logarithm is the inverse operation for raising the base to a power, just as extracting square roots is the inverse of squaring a number.  Every exponential equation can be rewritten in logarithmic form by using the conversion equations. Thus, are equivalent statements, just as are equivalent statements. Rewriting an equation in logarithmic form is a basic strategy for finding its solution.  QuickCheck 3   To find means to find an exponent that satisfies the equation                            Rewrite each equation in logarithmic form.       First identify the base , and then the exponent or logarithm . Use the conversion equations to rewrite in the form .  The base is and the exponent is . Thus, .  The base is and the exponent is .

There is no integer power of that equals , because Thus, must be between and . We can use trial and error to find the value of to the nearest tenth. Use your calculator to make a table of values for , starting with and using increments of .                                          From the table we see that is between and , and is closer to .

Approximate to the nearest hundredth.  If , then . We will use the graph of to approximate a solution to .  We graph ^ X and in the standard window ( ZOOM 6) to obtain the graph shown below. Next we activate the intersect feature to find that the two graphs intersect at the point . Because this point lies on the graph of , we know that To the nearest hundredth, .

Round your answer to three decimal places.                                        Base 10 Logarithms  Some logarithms are used so frequently in applications that their values are programmed into scientific and graphing calculators. These are the base logarithms, such as Base logarithms are called common logarithms common logarithms , and the subscript is often omitted, so that is understood to mean .

Many logarithms are irrational numbers, and the calculator gives as many digits as its display allows. We can then round off to the desired accuracy.  Approximate the following logarithms to decimal places.      The keying sequence LOG   ) ENTER produces the display             so .  The keying sequence LOG   )  ENTER yields , so .   We can check the approximations found in with our conversion equations. Remember that a logarithm is an exponent, and in this example the base is . We find that so our approximations are reasonable, although you can see that rounding a logarithm to decimal places does lose some accuracy.  For this reason, rounding logarithms to decimal places is customary.  Practice 5     Evaluate and round your answer to two decimal places.

Solving Exponential Equations  We can now solve any exponential equation with base . For instance, to solve the equation , we first divide both sides by to obtain Then we convert the equation to logarithmic form and evaluate: To decimal places, the solution is .  To solve exponential equations involving powers of 10, we can use the following steps.   Steps for Solving Base 10 Exponential Equations    Isolate the power on one side of the equation.  Rewrite the equation in logarithmic form.  Use a calculator, if necessary, to evaluate the logarithm.  Solve for the variable.     Solve the equation   First, we isolate the power of : We subtract from both sides of the equation and divide by to obtain Next, we convert the equation to logarithmic form as Solving for yields We can evaluate this expression on the calculator by entering  LOG   )  ÷   ENTER  which yields . Thus, to four decimal places, .  Be careful when using a calculator to evaluate expressions involving logs. We can evaluate a single logarithm like by entering LOG  ENTER without an ending parenthesis, so that the calculator shows             But if we want to evaluate , we must enclose in parentheses, as shown in . If we omit the parenthesis after , the calculator will interpret the expression as , which is not the expression we wanted.  QuickCheck 5   What is the first step in solving the equation    Multiply 5 times 10.    Take the log of both sides.    Get zero on one side of the equation.    Divide both sides by 5.          Divide both sides by 5.       Practice 6   Solve                Application to Exponential Models  We have seen that exponential functions are used to describe some applications of growth and decay, . There are two common questions that arise in connection with exponential models:  Given a value of , what is the corresponding value of ?  Given a value of , what is find the corresponding value of ?  To answer the first question, we evaluate the function at the appropriate value. To answer the second question, we must solve an exponential equation, and this usually involves logarithms.

  "body": " Properties of Logarithms  Introduction Because logarithms are actually exponents, they have several properties that can be derived from the laws of exponents. Here are the laws we will need at present.   To multiply two powers with the same base, add the exponents and leave the base unchanged.  To divide two powers with the same base, subtract the exponents and leave the base unchanged.  To raise a power to a power, keep the same base and multiply the exponents.   Each of these laws corresponds to one of three properties of logarithms.   Properties of Logarithms  If , , , and , then        We will consider proofs of the three properties of logarithms in the Homework problems. For now, study the examples below, keeping in mind that a logarithm is an exponent.   Property (1):  Property (2):  Property (3):   QuickCheck 1   Which statement is true?                             Using the Properties of Logarithms  Of course, these properties are useful not so much for computing logs but rather for simplifying expressions that contain variables. We will use them to solve exponential equations. But first, we will practice applying the properties. In the following Example , we rewrite one log in terms of simpler logs.  Simplify .  First, we write using a fractional exponent: Then we apply Property (3) to rewrite the exponent as a coefficient: Finally, by Property (1) we write the log of a product as a sum of logs: Thus, .  Practice 1   Simplify  Answer:                        Be careful when using the properties of logarithms! Compare the statements below:   but    but    We can also use the properties of logarithms to combine sums and differences of logarithms into one logarithm.  Express as a single logarithm with a coefficient of .  We begin by applying Property (2) to combine the logs. Then, using Property (3), we replace the coefficient by an exponent .  Practice 2   Express as a single logarithm with a coefficient of  Answer:              QuickCheck 2   Which expression is equivalent to                             Solving Exponential Equations  By using Property (3), we can now solve exponential equations in which the base is not . For example, to solve the equation we could rewrite the equation in logarithmic form to obtain the exact solution However, we cannot evaluate ; there is no log base button on the calculator. If we want a decimal approximation for the solution, we begin by taking the base logarithm of both sides, even though the base of the power is not . This gives us Then we use Property (3) to rewrite the left side as Note how using Property (3) allows us to solve the equation: The variable, , is no longer in the exponent, and it is multiplied by a constant, . To finish the solution, we divide both sides by to get On your calculator, enter the sequence  LOG   )  ÷  LOG   )  ENTER  to find that .  Do not confuse the expression with ; they are not the same! Property (2) allows us to simplify , but not . We cannot rewrite , so we must evaluate it as . You can check on your calculator that .  QuickCheck 3   How can we solve    A) Divide both sides by 4.    B) Take log base 10 of both sides.    C) Take the fourth root of 60.    D) This equation has no solution.          Take log base 10 of both sides.       Solve  First we divide both sides by to obtain Next, we take the base logarithm of both sides of the equation and use Property (3) of logarithms to get On the right side of the equation, is multiplied by two constants, and . So, to solve for we must divide both sides of the equation by . We use a calculator to evaluate the answer: (On your calculator, remember to enclose the denominator, , in parentheses.)  In , do not try to simplify Remember that the order of operations tells us to compute the power before multiplying by .  We summarize our method for solving exponential equations as follows.   Steps for Solving Exponential Equations    Isolate the power on one side of the equation.  Take the log base of both sides.  Simplify by applying Log Property (3).  Solve for the variable.     Practice 3   Solve                    Pause and Reflect   Explain why the distributive law does not apply to the expression        Applications  By using the properties of logarithms, we can now solve equations that arise in exponential growth and decay models, no matter what base the exponential function uses.  The population of Silicon City was in and has been tripling every years. When will the population reach ?  The population of Silicon City grows according to the formula where is the number of years after . We want to find the value of for which ; that is, we want to solve the equation Now we take the base logarithm of both sides and solve for . The population of Silicon City will reach about years after , or in .   Practice 4   Traffic on U.S. highways is growing by 2.7% per year. (Source: Time , Jan. 25, 1999)   Write a formula for the volume, of traffic as a function of time, using for the current volume. [Note: Enter V0 to get ]     How long will it take the volume of traffic to double? Hint: Find the value of that gives  Answer: about years                    about years         Pause and Reflect   How does Property (3) of logarithms help us solve exponential equations?        Compound Interest  The amount of money in an account that earns interest compounded annually grows exponentially according to the formula (See to review compound interest.) Many accounts compound interest more frequently than once a year. If the interest is compounded times per year, then in years there will be compounding periods, and in each period the account earns interest at a rate of . The amount accumulated is given by a generalization of our earlier formula.   Compound Interest  The amount accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account bearing interest compounded times annually is where      is the principal invested,      is the interest rate,     is the time period, in years.     Rashad deposited $ in an account that pays % interest. Calculate the amount in his account after years if the interest is compounded  semiannually  quarterly  monthly      Semiannually means \"twice a year,\"\" so we use the formula for compound interest with , , , and . If interest is compounded semiannually, the balance in the account after years is $ .   Quarterly means \"4 times a year,\"\" so we use the formula for compound interest with , , , and . If interest is compounded quarterly, the balance in the account after years is $ .  There are months in a year, so we use the formula for compound interest with , , , and . If interest is compounded monthly, the balance in the account after years is $ .   QuickCheck 4   Which formula gives the anount when interest is compounded quarterly?                            In , you can see that the larger the value of , the greater the value of , keeping the other parameters fixed. More frequent compounding periods result in a higher account balance.  Practice 5   Calculate the amount in Rashad s account after 5 years if the interest is compounded daily. (See Example 4.88. There are 365 days in a year.)  Answer: $        $1221.39        Solving Formulas  The techniques for solving exponential equations can also be used to solve formulas involving exponential expressions for one variable in terms of the others.  Solve for . (Assume that and .)  First, we divide both sides by to isolate the power. Next, we take the log base of both sides. Finally, we divide both sides by to solve for .  Practice 6   Solve for                 Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.  Compounding period     CONCEPTS     Properties of Logarithms  If , , , and , then        We can use the properties of logarithms to solve exponential equations with any base.   Steps for Solving Exponential Equations    Isolate the power on one side of the equation.  Take the log base of both sides.  Simplify by applying Log Property (3).  Solve for the variable.     The amount in an account earning interest compounded times per year is an exponential function of time.   Compound Interest  The amount accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account bearing interest compounded times annually is where      is the principal invested,      is the interest rate,     is the time period, in years.

We can find these two parameters if we know any two function values.  Find an exponential function that has the values and .  We would like to find values of and so that the given function values satisfy . By substituting the function values into the formula, we can write two equations. This is a system of equations in the two unknowns, and , but it is not a linear system. We can solve the system by the method of elimination, but we will divide one of the equations by the other. Note that by dividing the two equations, we eliminated , and we can now solve for . Next we substitute into either of the two equations and solve for . Thus, and , so the function is .  Knowing only two points on the graph of f is not enough to tell us what kind of function is. Through the two points in , we can also fit a linear function or a power function.  You can check that the three functions below all satisfy and . The graphs of the functions are shown at right.  three functions through the same two points   However, if we already know that we are looking for an exponential function, we can follow the steps below to find its formula. This method is sometimes called the ratio method ratio method . (Of course, if one of the known function values is the initial value, we can find without resorting to the ratio method.)   To find an exponential function through two points:     Use the coordinates of the points to write two equations in and .   Divide one equation by the other to eliminate .  Solve for .  Substitute into either equation and solve for .

Divide one equation by the other.       We can use the ratio method to find an exponential growth or decay model if we know two function values.  The unit of currency in Ghana is the cedi, denoted by ¢. Beginning in 1986, the cedi underwent a period of exponential inflation. In 1993, one U.S. dollar was worth ¢720, and in 1996, the dollar was worth about ¢1620. Find a formula for the number of cedi to the dollar as a function of time since 1986. What was the annual inflation rate?  We want to find a function for the number of cedi to the dollar, where in 1986. We have two function values, , and , and with these values we can write two equations. We divide the second equation by the first to find Now we can solve this last equation for to get . Finally, we substitute into the first equation to find . Thus, , and the annual inflation rate was %.  Practice 2   The number of earthquakes that occur worldwide is a decreasing exponential function of their magnitude on the Richter scale. Between 2000 and 2005, there were 7480 earthquakes of magnitude 5 and 793 earthquakes of magnitude 6. (Source: National Earthquake Information Center, U.S. Geological Survey)    Find a formula for the number of earthquakes, in terms of their magnitude.   Do not use any commas: For example, instead of 10,000 enter simply 10000 .    It is difficult to keep an accurate count of small earthquakes. Use your formula to estimate the number of magnitude 1 earthquakes that occurred between 2000 and 2005.  How many earthquakes of magnitude 8 occurred?                                   Doubling Time doubling time  Instead of giving the rate of growth of a population, we can specify its rate of growth by giving the time it takes for the population to double.  In 2005, the population of Egypt was million and was growing by % per year.  If it continues to grow at the same rate, how long will it take the population of Egypt to double?  How long will it take the population to double again?  Illustrate the results on a graph.    The population of Egypt is growing according to the formula , where is in years and is in millions. We would like to know when the population will reach million (twice million), so we solve the equation It will take the population about years to double.  Twice 148 million is 296 million, so we solve the equation It will take the population about years to double again.  A graph of is shown below. Note that the population doubles every 35 years.  graph showing doubling time   In , it took the population years to double. Notice that the calculations in parts (a) and (b) are identical after the first step. In fact, we can start at any point, and it will take the population years to double. We say that years is the doubling time for this population. In the Homework problems, you will show that any increasing exponential function has a constant doubling time.  QuickCheck 2   Which statement is true?    A) The doubling time of a population depends on its initial value.    B) An increasing exponential function has a constant doubling time.    C) The doubling time is twice the percent growth rate.    D) The doubling time is half the percent growth rate.          An increasing exponential function has a constant doubling time.       Practice 3   In 2005, the population of Uganda was 26.9 million people and was growing by 3.2% per year.    Write a formula for the population of Uganda as a function of years since 2005.  million    How long will it take the population of Uganda to double?  years    Use your formula from part (a) to verify the doubling time for three doubling periods.                 million    years     i.e.,  i.e.,  i.e.,         If we know the doubling time for a population, we can immediately write down its growth law. Because the population of Egypt doubles in 35 years, we can write In this form, the growth factor for the population is , and you can check that, to five decimal places, .  Doubling Time doubling time  If is the doubling time for an exponential function , then   QuickCheck 3   The formula tells us that:    is twice the initial value.    After 2 years, .    After years, .    grows by a factor of .          After years,       So, from knowing the doubling time, we can easily find the growth rate of a population.   At its current rate of growth, the population of the United States will double in years.  Write a formula for the population of the United States as a function of time.  What is the annual percent growth rate of the population?    The current population of the United States is not given, so we represent it by . With expressed in years, the formula is then  We write in the form to see that the growth factor is , or . For exponential growth, , so , or %.   Practice 4   At its current rate of growth, the population of Mexico will double in 36.8 years. What is its annual percent rate of growth?  Answer: %        1.9%       Pause and Reflect   How can you find the growth factor for an exponential function when you know its doubling time?        Half-Life  The half-life half-life of a decreasing exponential function is the time it takes for the output to decrease to half its original value. For example, the half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The half-life of a drug is the time it takes for half of the drug to be eliminated from the body. Like the doubling time, the half-life is constant for a particular function; no matter where you start, it takes the same amount of time to reach half that value.   If you take mg of ibuprofen to relieve sore muscles, the amount of the drug left in your body after hours is .  What is the half-life of ibuprofen?  When will mg of ibuprofen remain in your body?  Use the half-life to sketch a graph of .    To find the half-life, we calculate the time elapsed when only half the original amount, or mg, is left. The half-life is hours.  After hours, mg of ibuprofen is left in the body. After another hours, half of that amount, or mg, is left. Thus, mg remain after hours.  We locate multiples of hours on the horizontal axis. After each interval of hours, the amount of ibuprofen is reduced to half its previous value. The graph is shown below.   graph showing half-life                   QuickCheck 4   The half-life of DDT is 15 years. This means that:    A) 30 pounds of DDT dissolve in one year.    B) 100 pounds of DDT dissolve in 30 years.    C) After 30 years, 100 pounds of DDT is reduced to 25 pounds.    D) Each half-pound of DDT takes 15 years to dissolve.          After 30 years, 100 pounds of DDT is reduced to 25 pounds.       Practice 5   Alcohol is eliminated from the body at a rate of 15% per hour.    Write a decay formula for the amount of alcohol remaining in the body, using for the initial amount of alcohol. [Note: Enter A to get ].     What is the half-life of alcohol in the body?  hours                    hours         Just as we can write an exponential growth law in terms of its doubling time, we can use the half-life to write a formula for exponential decay. For example, the half-life of ibuprofen is hours, so every hours the amount remaining is reduced by a factor of . After hours a -mg dose will be reduced to Once again, you can check that this formula is equivalent to the decay function given in .  Half-Life half-life  If is the half-life for an exponential function , then   Radioactive isotopes are molecules that decay into more stable molecules, emitting radiation in the process. Although radiation in large doses is harmful to living things, radioactive isotopes are useful as tracers in medicine and industry, and as treatment against cancer. The decay laws for radioactive isotopes are often given in terms of their half-lives.   Cobalt-60 is used in cold pasteurization to sterilize certain types of food. Gamma rays emitted by the isotope during radioactive decay kill any bacteria present without damaging the food. The half-life of cobalt-60 is years.  Write a decay law for cobalt-60.  What is the annual decay rate for cobalt-60?    We let denote the amount of cobalt-60 left after years, and let denote the initial amount. Every years, is reduced by a factor of , so  We rewrite the decay law in the form as follows: Thus, , so , or %.   Practice 6   Cesium-137, with a half-life of 30 years, is one of the most dangerous by-products of nuclear fission. What is the annual decay rate for cesium-137?  Answer: %              Pause and Reflect   How can you use the half-life to sketch a graph of an exponential function?        Annuities and Amortization  An annuity annuity is a sequence of equal payments or deposits made at equal time intervals. A retirement fund is an example of an annuity. For ordinary annuities, payments are made at the end of each compounding period. The future value future value of an annuity is the sum of all the payments plus all the interest earned.   Future Value of an Annuity  If you make payments per year for years into an annuity that pays interest rate compounded times per year, the future value future value , , of the annuity is where each payment is dollars.   Greta plans to contribute $ a month to a retirement fund that pays % interest compounded monthly.  What is the future value of Greta's retirement fund after years?  For how many years must she contribute in order to accumulate $100,000?    We evaluate the formula for when , , , and . Substituting these values into the formula, we find In years, Greta's retirement fund will be worth $ .  We would like to find the value of when , , , and , so we must solve the equation Greta must contribute for over years in order to accumulate $ .   Practice 7   Rufus is saving for a new car. He puts $2500 a year into an account that pays 4% interest compounded annually. How many years will it take him to accumulate $20,000? (Round up to the next whole year.)  Answer: years        8 years       In , we knew the monthly deposits into the annuity and calculated how much the sum of all the deposits (plus interest) would be in the future. Now imagine that you have just retired and you want to begin drawing monthly payments from your retirement fund. The total amount accumulated in your fund is now its present value , and that amount must cover your future withdrawal payments.   Present Value of an Annuity  If you wish to receive payments per year for years from a fund that earns interest rate compounded times per year, the present value present value , , of the annuity must be where each payment is dollars.   Candace Welthy is setting up a college fund for her nephew Delbert that will provide $ a month for the next years. If the interest rate is % compounded monthly, how much money should she deposit now to cover the fund?  We would like to find the present value of an annuity in which , , , and . Substituting these values into the formula gives Delbert's Aunt Welthy should deposit $ .  Payments on a loan, such as a home mortgage, are also an annuity, but in this case the monthly payments do not collect interest; instead, we must pay interest on the present value of the loan. Repaying a loan (plus interest) by making a sequence of equal payments is called amortizing amortize the loan.  Practice 8   Use the formula for the present value of an annuity to calculate your monthly mortgage payment on a home loan of $250,000 amortized over 30 years at 6% interest compounded monthly.  $                Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

Do not use any commas: For example, instead of 10,000 enter simply 10000 .    It is difficult to keep an accurate count of small earthquakes. Use your formula to estimate the number of magnitude 1 earthquakes that occurred between 2000 and 2005.  How many earthquakes of magnitude 8 occurred?                                 "

The constant is called the growth factor growth factor if and the decay factor decay factor if .  Quantities that increase or decrease by a constant percent in each time period grow or decay exponentially.   Exponential Growth and Decay The function models exponential growth and decay.  is the initial value of ;  is the growth or decay factor.   If , then is increasing, and , where represents percent increase.  If , then is decreasing, and , where represents percent decrease.      Interest Compounded Annually The amount accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account bearing interest compounded annually is where      is the principal invested,      is the interest rate,     is the time period, in years.      In linear growth, a constant amount is added to the output for each unit increase in the input. In exponential growth, the output is multiplied by a constant factor for each unit increase in the input.  An exponential function exponential function has the form    Properties of Exponential Functions,   Domain: all real numbers  Range: all positive numbers  If , the function is increasing and concave up; if , the function is decreasing and concave up.  The -intercept is . There is no -intercept     The graphs of exponential functions can be transformed by shifts, stretches, and reflections.   Reflections of Graphs   The graph of is the reflection of the graph of about the -axis.  The graph of is the reflection of the graph of about the -axis.     Exponential functions have different properties than power functions .  We can solve exponential equations by writing both sides with the same base and equating the exponents.  We can use graphs to find approximate solutions to exponential equations.  We use logrithms to help us solve exponential equations.  The base logarithm of , written , is the exponent to which must be raised in order to yield .  If , , and ,   The operation of taking a base logarithm is the inverse operation for raising the base to a power.  Base 10 logarithms are called common logarithms , and means .   Steps for Solving Base 10 Exponential Equations   Isolate the power on one side of the equation.  Rewrite the equation in logarithmic form.  Use a calculator, if necessary, to evaluate the logarithm.  Solve for the variable.      Properties of Logarithms  If , , , and , then        We can use the properties of logarithms to solve exponential equations with any base.   Compounded Interest The amount accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account bearing interest compounded times annually is where      is the principal invested,      is the interest rate,     is the time period, in years.      We can use the ratio method to fit an exponential function through two points.  To find an exponential function through two points:   Use the coordinates of the points to write two equations in and .  Divide one equation by the other to eliminate .  Solve for .  Substitute into either equation and solve for .     Every increasing exponential has a fixed doubling time . Every decreasing exponential function has a fixed half-life .

  "body": " Projects for Chapter 4  Bode's Law In 1772, the astronomer Johann Bode promoted a formula for the orbital radii of the six planets known at the time. This formula calculated the orbital radius, , as a function of the planet's position, , in line from the Sun. (Source: Bolton, 1974)  Evaluate Bode's law, for the values in the table. (Use a large negative number, such as , to approximate .)                         How do the values of compare with the actual orbital radii of the planets shown in the table? (The radii are given in astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, about kilometers.) Assign values of to each of the planets so that they conform to Bode's law.    Planet  Mercury  Venus  Earth  Mars  Jupiter  Saturn    Orbitan radius (AU)                    In 1781, William Herschel discovered the planet Uranus at a distance of AU from the Sun. If for Uranus, what does Bode's law predict for the orbital radius of Uranus?  None of the planets’ orbital radii corresponds to in Bode's law. However, in 1801 the first of a group of asteroids between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter was discovered. The asteroids have orbital radii between and AU. If we consider the asteroids as one planet, what orbital radius does Bode's law predict?  In 1846, Neptune was discovered AU from the Sun, and Pluto was discovered in 1930 AU from the Sun. What orbital radii does Bode's law predict for these planets?    Plague In 1665, there was an outbreak of the plague in London. The table shows the number of people who died of plague during each week of the summer that year.

On the same axes, graph the function .  By what weekly percent rate did the number of victims increase during the first eight weeks?  Add data points for July 11 through October 10 to your graph. Describe the progress of the epidemic relative to the function and offer an explanation.  Make a table showing the total number of plague victims at the end of each week and plot the data. Describe the graph.    Koch snowflake The Koch snowflake is an example of a fractal. It is named in honor of the Swiss mathematician Niels Fabian Helge von Koch (1870 1924). Here is how to construct a Koch snowflake:  Draw an equilateral triangle with sides of length unit. This is stage .  Divide each side into equal segments and draw a smaller equilateral triangle on each middle segment, as shown in the figure. The new figure (stage ) is a -pointed star with sides.  Repeat the process to obtain stage : Trisect each of the sides and draw an equilateral triangle on each middle third.  If you continue this process forever, the resulting figure is the Koch snowflake .    Koch snowflake    We will consider several functions related to the Koch snowflake:    is the length of each side in stage    is the number of sides in stage    is the perimeter of the snowflake at stage    Fill in the table describing the snowflake at each stage.    Stage                                Write an expression for .  Write an expression for .  Write an expression for .  What happens to the perimeter as gets larger and larger?  As increases, the area of the snowflake increases also. Is the area of the completed Koch snowflake finite or infinite?    Sierpinski carpet The Sierpinski carpet is another fractal. It is named for the Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski (1882 1969). Here is how to build a Sierpinski carpet:  Start with a unit square (sides of length 1 unit.)  For stage , trisect each side and partition the square into 9 smaller squares. Remove the center square, leaving a hole surrounded by 8 squares, as shown in the figure.  For stage , repeat the process on each of the remaining 8 squares.  If you continue this process forever, the resulting is the Sierpinski carpet .    Sierpinski carpet    We will consider several functions related to the Sierpinski carpet:    is the side of a new square at stage    is the area of a new square at stage    is the number of new squares removed at stage    is the total area removed at stage    is the total area remaining at stage    Fill in the table describing the carpet at each stage.    Stage                                          Write an expression for .  Write an expression for .  Write an expression for .  Write an expression for .  Write an expression for .  What happens to the area remaining as approaches infinity?    Stream order The order of a stream or river is a measure of its relative size. A first-order stream is the smallest, one that has no tributaries. Second-order streams have only first-order streams as tributaries. Third-order streams may have first- and second-order streams as tributaries, and so on. The Mississippi River is an example of a tenth-order stream, and the Columbia River is ninth order.  Both the number of streams of a given order and their average length are exponential functions of their order. In this problem, we consider all streams in the United States. (Source: Leopold, Luna, Gordon, and Miller, 1992)  Using the given values, find a function for the number of streams of a given order.  Complete the column for number of streams of each order.

In Projects 7 and 8, we will prove the formulas in for the present and future values of an annuity.  The future value future value of of money is its value in the future: its current value plus the interest it will accrue in the interval.  The present value present value of of money is the amount you would need to deposit now so that it will grow to in the future.  Future value Suppose you deposit at the end of every months into an account that pays compounded annually. How much money will be in the account at the end of years?  During the years, you will make deposits. Use the formula to write an expression for the future value (principal plus interest) of each deposit. (Do not evaluate the expression!)

Present value You would like to set up an account that pays interest compounded semiannually so that you can withdraw at the end of every months for the next years. How much should you deposit now?

The table shows mortgage payments on -year loans of various sizes at % interest.    Loan amount,        Mortgage payment,        For the function , the input value is the amount of the loan, and the output is the mortgage payment.  However, when you are shopping for a house, you may think of the mortgage payment as the input variable: If you can afford a certain monthly mortgage payment, how large a loan can you finance? Now the mortgage payment is the input value, and the loan amount is the output. By interchanging the inputs and outputs, we define a new function, , shown below.    Mortgage payment,        Loan amount,        This new function gives the same information as the original function, , but from a different point of view. We call the function the inverse function inverse function for .  The elements of the range of are used as the input values for , and the output values of are the corresponding domain elements of . For example, from the tables you can verify that , and . In fact, this property defines the inverse function.  Inverse Functions  Suppose is the inverse function inverse function for .

For the inverse function , the roles of the variables are interchanged: is now the input and is the output.  Practice 1   Suppose is the inverse function for and suppose we know the following function values for f :   Find and                      QuickCheck 1   If the point lies on the graph of what point lies on the graph of its inverse function?                             Finding a Formula for the Inverse Function  If a function is given by a table of values, we can interchange the columns (or rows) of the table to obtain the inverse function. Swapping the columns works because we are really interchanging the input and output variables. If a function is defined by an equation, we can find a formula for its inverse function in the same way: Interchange the roles of the variables in the equation so that the old output variable becomes the new input variable.   The function gives the height of corn seedlings, in inches, days after they are planted. Find a formula for the inverse function and explain its meaning in this context.  Make a table of values for and a table for its inverse function.    Write the equation for in the form In this equation, is the input and is the output. We interchange the roles of the variables by solving for to obtain In this equation, is the input and is the output. The formula for the inverse function is The function gives the number of days it will take the corn seedlings to grow to a height of inches.  To make a table for , we choose values for and evaluate at those -values, as shown at left below.                                          To make a table for , we could choose values for and evaluate , but because is the inverse function for , we can simply interchange the columns in our table for , as shown at right above.  You can check that the values in the second table do satisfy the formula for the inverse function, .   Note once again that the two tables show the same relationship between and , but the roles of input and output have been interchanged. The function tells us the height of the seedlings after days, and tells us how long it will take the seedlings to grow to height .

If Carol swims for hrs, she must cycle for hrs.          Inverse Function Notation inverse function notation  If the inverse of a function is also a function, we denote the inverse by the symbol , read \" inverse.\" This notation makes it clear that the two functions are related in a special way. For example, the function in has inverse function .  If find .   We first find the inverse function for by solving for : The inverse function is . Now we evaluate the inverse function at :  Although the same symbol, , is used for both reciprocals and inverse functions, the two notions are not equivalent. That is, the inverse of a given function is usually not the same as the reciprocal of that function. In , note that is not the same as the reciprocal of , because To avoid confusion, we use the notation to refer to the reciprocal of the function .  In , you can check that . In fact, the two statements are equivalent; they convey the same information. This fact is a restatement of our earlier observation about inverse functions, this time using inverse function notation.  QuickCheck 3   If what is equal to?

We can always find the inverse of a function simply by interchanging the input and output variables. In the preceding examples, interchanging the variables created a new function. However, the inverse of a function does not always turn out to be a function itself.  For example, to find the inverse of , we solve for to get . When we regard as the input and as the output, the relationship does not describe a function. The graphs of and its inverse are shown below. (Note that for the graph of the inverse, we plot on the horizontal axis and on the vertical axis.) Because the graph of the inverse does not pass the vertical line test, it is not a function.  graphs of x-squared and its inverse  For many applications, it is important to know whether or not the inverse of is a function. This can be determined from the graph of . When we interchange the roles of the input and output variables, horizontal lines of the form become vertical lines.  Thus, if the graph of the inverse is going to pass the vertical line test, the graph of the original function must pass the horizontal line test horizontal line test , namely, that no horizontal line should intersect the graph in more than one point.  Horizontal Line Test horizontal line test  If no horizontal line intersects the graph of a function more than once, then its inverse is also a function.   Notice that the graph of does not pass the horizontal line test, so we would not expect its inverse to be a function.  Which of the functions shown below have inverses that are also functions?  graphs for vertical line test  In each case, we apply the horizontal line test to determine whether the inverse is a function. Because no horizontal line intersects their graphs more than once, the functions pictured in figures (a) and (c) have inverses that are also functions. The functions in figures (b) and (d) do not have inverses that are functions.  Practice 6  graphs for vertical line test    Which of the functions whose graphs are shown above have inverses that are also functions?      Yes    No        Yes    No        Yes    No        Yes    No                           (a) and (d)       A function that passes the horizontal line test is called one-to-one one-to-one , because each input has only one output and each output has only one input. A one-to-one function passes the horizontal line test as well as the vertical line test. With this terminology, we can state the following theorem.  One-to-one Functions  The inverse of a function is also a function if and only if is one-to-one.   A function may have an inverse function even if we cannot find its formula. The function shown in figure (a) is one-to-one, so it has an inverse function. We can even graph the inverse function, as shown in figure (b), by interchanging the coordinates of points on the graph of .  graphs of f and f-inverse  However, we cannot find a formula for the inverse function because we cannot solve the equation for in terms of .  Pause and Reflect   What does the term one-to-one mean? Give an example.        Mathematical Properties of the Inverse Function  The inverse function undoes the effect of the function . In , the function multiplies the input by and then adds to the result. The inverse function undoes those operations in reverse order: It subtracts from the input and then divides the result by .  If we apply the function to a given input value and then apply the function to the output from , the end result will be the original input value. For example, if we choose as an input value, we find that  function and inverse diagram  We return to the original input value, , as illustrated above.  QuickCheck 4   An inverse function    A) makes the output negative.    B) makes the input negative.    C) interchanges the input and output.    D) takes the reciprocal of the output.          interchanges the input and output.       illustrates the fact that if is the inverse function for , then is also the inverse function for .

Then as long as is in the domain of , and is in the domain of .    Symmetry  So far we have been careful to keep track of the input and output variables when we work with inverse functions. This is important when we are dealing with applications; the names of the variables are usually chosen because they have a meaning in the context of the application, and it would be confusing to change them.  However, we can also study inverse functions purely as mathematical objects. There is a relationship between the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse that is easier to see if we plot them both on the same set of axes.  A graph does not change if we change the names of the variables, so we can let represent the input for both functions, and let represent the output. Consider the function from , and its inverse function, . The formulas for these functions are But their graphs are the same if we write them as The graphs are shown below.  graphs of both function and inverse  Now, for every point on the graph of , the point is on the graph of the inverse function. Observe that the points and are always located symmetrically across the line . The graphs are symmetric about the line , which means that if we were to place a mirror along the line , each graph would be the reflection of the other.

Domain and Range  When we interchange the input and output variables to obtain the inverse function, we interchange the domain and range of the function.

  "body": " Logarithmic Functions  Inverse of the Exponential Function  Inverse functions are really a generalization of inverse operations. For example, raising to the th power and taking th roots are inverse operations. In fact, we use the following rule to define cube roots: Compare this rule to the definition of inverse functions from . In this case, if and , we see that We have shown that the two functions and are inverse functions.  In , we saw that a similar rule relates the operations of raising a base to a power and taking a base logarithm, because they are inverse operations.  Conversion Formulas for Logarithms  For any base ,   We can now define the logarithmic function , , that takes the log base of its input values. The conversion formulas tell us that the log function, , is the inverse of the exponential function, .  Logarithmic Function  The logarithmic function logarithmic function base , , is the inverse of the exponential function of the same base, .   QuickCheck 1   The domain of the function is    all real numbers.    all multiples of 3.    all non-negative numbers.    all positive numbers.          The domain of the function is all positive numbers.       For example, the function is the inverse of . Each function undoes the effect of the other. So, if we start with , apply , and then apply to the result, we return to the original number, 3. We can write both calculations together as A similar equation holds for any value of and for any base . In other words, applying first the exponential function and then the log function returns the original input value, so that  Simplify each expression.      In this expression, we start with , apply the exponential function with base , and then take a logarithm base . Because the logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function, we return to the original number, .  The input of the exponential function is the expression . Because the bases of the log and the exponential function are both , they are inverse functions, and applying them in succession returns us to the original input. Thus, .   Practice 1   Simplify each expression.      , for                            We can also apply the two functions in the opposite order. For example, To see that this equation is true, we simplify the exponent first. We start with , and apply the log base function. Because , we have Of course, a similar equation holds for any positive value of and any base :  Simplify each expression.      In this expression, we start with , take the logarithm base , and then apply the exponential function base to the result. We return to the original input, so  The log function, , and the exponential function, , are inverse functions, so   Practice 2   Simplify each expression.                                 We summarize these relationships as follows.   Exponential and Logarithmic Functions  Because and are inverse functions for ,     Graphs of Logarithmic Functions  We can obtain a table of values for by making a table for and then interchanging the columns, as shown in the tables below. You can see that the graphs of and , shown in the figre, are symmetric about the line .                                          graph of log and exponential base 2  The same procedure works for graphing log functions with any base: If we want to find values for the function , we can find the values for the exponential function , and then interchange the and values in each ordered pair.

  "body": " Logarithmic Scales  Introduction  Because logarithmic functions grow very slowly, they are useful for modeling phenomena that take on a very wide range of values. For example, biologists study how metabolic functions such as heart rate are related to an animal’s weight, or mass. The table shows the mass in kilograms of several mammals.    Animal  Shrew  Cat  Wolf  Horse  Elephant  Whale   Mass, kg         Imagine trying to scale the -axis to show all of these values. If we set tick marks at intervals of kg, as shown below, we can plot the mass of the whale, and maybe the elephant, but the dots for the smaller animals will be indistinguishable.  number line with masses of mammals  On the other hand, we can plot the mass of the cat if we set tick marks at intervals of kg, but the axis will have to be extremely long to include even the wolf. We cannot show the masses of all these animals on the same scale  number line with masses of mammals  To get around this problem, we can plot the log of the mass, instead of the mass itself. The table below shows the base 10 log of each animal's mass, rounded to decimal places.    Animal  Shrew  Cat  Wolf  Horse  Elephant  Whale   Mass, kg         Log (mass)         The logs of the masses range from to . We can easily plot these values on a single scale, as shown below.  mammal masses plotted on log scale  The scale above is called a logarithmic scale logarithmic scale , or log scale. The tick marks are labeled with powers of , because, as you recall, a logarithm is actually an exponent. For example, the mass of the horse is kg, and When we plot for the horse, we are really plotting the power of that gives its mass, because kg. The exponents on base are evenly spaced on a log scale, so we plot about halfway between and .  Plot the values on a log scale.             We actually plot the logs of the values, so we first compute the base logarithm of each number.                      Then we plot each logarithm, estimating its position between integer exponents. For example, we plot the first value, , closer to than to . The finished plot is shown below.  points plotted on log scale  QuickCheck 1   A value of 5682.7 would be plotted between which two integers on a log scale?    5682 and 5683    5000 and 6000    5 and 6    3 and 4          3 and 4       Practice 1  points on logscale    Complete the table by estimating the logarithm of each point plotted on the log scale above. Then use a calculator to give a decimal value for each point.                                                                                            QuickCheck 2   What is a log scale used for?    A) To find the logarithm of a number.    B) To plot data that covers a wide range of values.    C) To highlight the curvature in the graph of an exponential function.    D) To convert logarithms to base 10.          To plot data that covers a wide range of values.        Using Log Scales  By now, you have noticed that the values represented by points on a log scale increase rapidly as we move to the right along the scale. Also notice that , so the \"middle\" of a log scale represents (not zero, as on a linear scale).  Points to the left of represent fractions between and , because powers of with negative exponents are numbers less than . Their values decrease toward as we move to the left, but they never become negative.  We cannot plot negative numbers or zero on a log scale, because the log of a negative number or zero is undefined.  The figure shows a timeline for life on Earth, in units of Mya (million years ago).  timeline of events on a logscale  Approximately how long ago did each of the following events occur?  Formation of Earth  Dinosaurs became extinct  The last ice age  The Crusades    We read from the timeline that the Earth was formed between and , or between and million years ago. We estimate that Earth formed million years ago.  The extinction of the dinosaurs is plotted between and , or between and million years ago. Because the point is closer to , we estimate their extinction at million years ago.  The last ice age is plotted just after , or million years ago. One-hundredth of a million is , so we estimate that the ice age occurred a little more than years ago.  The Crusades occurred about , or about million years ago. One-thousandth of a million is , so the Crusades occurred about years ago, or about A.D.   Practice 2   Plot the following dollar values on a log scale.

Equal Increments on a Log Scale  Log scales allow us to plot a wide range of values, but there is a trade-off. Equal increments on a log scale do not correspond to equal differences in value, as they do on a linear scale. You can see why in the figure below: The difference between and is , but the difference between and is .  logscale with integer exponents  If we include tick marks for intermediate values on the log scale, they look like this.  logscale with decimal exponents  Once again, the difference between, say, and is not the same as the difference between and . The decimal values of the powers through , rounded to two places, are shown below.  logscale showing values of powers  As we move from left to right on this scale, we multiply the value at the previous tick mark by , or about . For example, and so on. Moving up by equal increments on a log scale does not add equal amounts to the values plotted; it multiplies the values by equal factors .  QuickCheck 3   Which statement is false?    A) We use log scales to graph a variable that has a wide range of values.    B) On a log scale, we actually plot exponents.    C) Values less than one appear as negative numbers on a log scale.    D) Equal increments on a log scale correspond to equal differences in value.          Equal increments on a log scale correspond to equal differences in value is a false statement.       What number is halfway between and on a log scale?  On a log scale, the number is halfway between and , as shown below.  log scale showing point halfway between 10 and 100  Now, , or approximately . Note how equal increments of on the log scale correspond to equal factors of in the values plotted:  Practice 3   What number is halfway between and on a log scale?  Answer:              If we would like to label the log scale with integers, we get a very different-looking scale, one in which the tick marks are not evenly spaced.  Plot the integer values 2 through 9 and 20 through 90 on a log scale.  We compute the logarithm of each integer value.                                              We plot on a log scale, as shown below.  log scale showing integer points  On the log scale in , notice how the integer values are spaced: They get closer together as they approach the next power of . You will often see log scales labeled not with powers of , but with integer values, like this:  log scale showing tic marks at integer points  In fact, log-log graph paper log-log graph paper scales both axes with logarithmic scales.  Practice 4  mouse-to-elephant curve on log-log graph    The opening page of Chapter 3 shows the mouse-to-elephant curve, a graph of the metabolic rate of mammals as a function of their mass. (The elephant does not appear on that graph, because its mass is too big.) The figure above shows the same function, graphed on log-log paper.  Use this graph to estimate the mass and metabolic rate for the following animals, labeled on the graph.         Animal  Mouse  Dog  Sheep    Mass (kg)       Metabolic rate (kcal\/day)            Animal  Cow  Elephant    Mass (kg)      Metabolic rate (kcal\/day)                                                                  Animal  Mouse  Dog  Sheep  Cow  Elephant    Mass (kg)         Metabolic rate (kcal\/day)              Pause and Reflect   If the difference between and on a log scale is 2 units. Use the properties of logarithms to explain why this is true.        Acidity and the pH Scale  You may have already encountered log scales in some everyday applications. A simple example is the pH scale pH scale , used by chemists to measure the acidity of a substance or chemical compound. This scale is based on the concentration of hydrogen ions in the substance, denoted by . The pH value is defined by the formula Values for pH fall between and , with indicating a neutral solution. The lower the pH value, the more acidic the substance. Some common substances and their pH values are shown in the table.     Substance  pH    Battery acid     Lemon juice     Vinegar     Milk     Baking soda     Milk of magnesia     Lye      Calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of .  The water in a swimming pool should be maintained at a pH of . What is the hydrogen ion concentration of the water?    We use a calculator to evaluate the pH formula with .  We solve the equation for . First, we write Then we convert the equation to exponential form to get The hydrogen ion concentration of the water is .   Practice 5   The pH of the water in a tide pool is What is the hydrogen ion concentration of the water?  Answer:              A decrease of on the pH scale corresponds to an increase in acidity by a factor of . Thus, lemon juice is times more acidic than vinegar, and battery acid is times more acidic than vinegar.   Decibels  The decibel scale decibel scale , used to measure the loudness or intensity of a sound, is another example of a logarithmic scale. The loudness of a sound is measured in decibels, by where is the intensity of its sound waves (in watts per square meter). The table below shows the intensity of some common sounds, measured in watts per square meter.    Sound  Intensity (watts\/m )  Decibels   Whisper     Background music     Loud conversation     Heavy traffic     Jet airplane     Thunder     Consider the ratio of the intensity of thunder to that of a whisper: Thunder is , or one billion times more intense than a whisper. It would be impossible to show such a wide range of values on a graph. When we use a log scale, however, there is a difference of only 90 decibels between a whisper and thunder.   Normal breathing generates about watts per square meter at a distance of feet. Find the number of decibels for a breath feet away.  Normal conversation registers at about decibels. How many times more intense than breathing is normal conversation?    We evaluate the decibel formula with to find  We let stand for the sound intensity of breathing, and stand for the intensity of normal conversation. We are looking for the ratio . From part (a), we know that and from the formula for decibels, we have which we can solve for . Dividing both sides of the equation by and rewriting in exponential form, we have Finally, we compute the ratio : Normal conversation is times more intense than breathing.   Practice 6   The noise of city traffic registers at about decibels.    What is the intensity of traffic noise, in watts per square meter?  Answer: watts\/m    How many times more intense is traffic noise than conversation?  Answer: times                 watts\/m            Both the decibel model and the Richter scale in the next example use expressions of the form . Be careful to follow the order of operations when using these models. We must compute the quotient before taking a logarithm. In particular, recall that is not equivalent to .   The Richter Scale  One method for measuring the magnitude of an earthquake compares the amplitude of its seismographic trace with the amplitude of the smallest detectable earthquake. The log of their ratio is the Richter Richter magnitude, . Thus,   The Northridge earthquake of January 1994 registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. What would be the magnitude of an earthquake 100 times as powerful as the Northridge quake?  How many times more powerful than the Northridge quake was the San Francisco earthquake of 1989, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale?    We let represent the amplitude of the Northridge quake and represent the amplitude of a quake times more powerful. From the Richter model, we have or, rewriting in exponential form, Now, , so Thus, the magnitude of the more powerful quake is  We let stand for the amplitude of the San Francisco earthquake. We are looking for the ratio . First, we use the Richter formula to compute values for and . Rewriting each equation in exponential form, we have or Now we can compute the ratio we want: The San Francisco earthquake was , or approximately times as powerful as the Northridge quake.   Practice 7   In October 2005, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Pakistan. How much more powerful was this earthquake than the 1989 San Francisco earthquake of magnitude 7.1?  Answer:              An earthquake , or , times as strong is only two units greater in magnitude on the Richter scale. In general, a difference of units on the Richter scale (or any logarithmic scale) corresponds to a factor of units in the intensity of the quake.  QuickCheck 4   How much stronger is magnitude 4 earthquake than a magnitude 2 earthquake?    Twice as strong.    Four times as strong.    16 times as strong.    100 times as strong.          100 times as strong.       On a log scale, the weights of two animals differ by units. What is the ratio of their actual weights?  A difference of on a log scale corresponds to a factor of in the actual weights. Thus, the heavier animal is , or times as heavy as the lighter animal.  Practice 8   Two points, labeled and differ by units on a log scale. What is the ratio of their decimal values?  Answer:              Pause and Reflect   Explain what negative values on a log scale mean.         Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.  Log scale  Log-log paper     CONCEPTS    A log scale is useful for plotting values that vary greatly in magnitude. We plot the log of the variable instead of the variable itself.  A log scale is a multiplicative scale : Each increment of equal length on the scale indicates that the value is multiplied by an equal amount.  The pH value of a substance is defined by the formula where denotes the concentration of hydrogen ions in the substance.  The loudness of a sound is measured in decibels, , by where is the intensity of its sound waves (in watts per square meter).  The Richter magnitude, , of an earthquake is given by where is the amplitude of its seismographic trace and is the amplitude of the smallest detectable earthquake.  A difference of units on a logarithmic scale corresponds to a factor of units in the value of the variable.    STUDY QUESTIONS   What numbers are used to label the axis on a log scale?

Have you ever wondered why time seems to pass more quickly as we grow older? One theory suggests that the human mind judges the length of a long period of time by comparing it with its current age. For example, a year is of a -year-old's lifetime, but only of a -year-old's, so a year feels longer to a -year-old. Thus, psychological time follows a log scale, like the one shown in the figure.  ages on log scale   Label the tick marks with their base logarithms, rounded to decimal places.

If a function is defined by a formula in the form , we can find a formula for its inverse function by solving the equation for to get .  The inverse function undoes the effect of the function , that is, if we apply the inverse function to the output of , we return to the original input value.  If is the inverse function for , then is also the inverse function for .  The graphs of and its inverse function are symmetric about the line .   Horizontal line test : If no horizontal line intersects the graph of a function more than once, then the inverse is also a function.  A function that passes the horizontal line test is called one-to-one .  The inverse of a function is also a function if and only if is one-to-one.  We define the logarithmic function, , which takes the log base of its input values. The log function is the inverse of the exponential function .   Because and are inverse functions for ,     Logarithmic Functions    Domain: all positive real numbers  Range: all real numbers   -intercept:    -intercept: none  Vertical asymptote at   The graphs of and are symmetric about the line .     A logarithmic equation is one where the variable appears inside of a logarithm. We can solve logarithmic equations by converting to exponential form.   Steps for Solving Logarithmic Equations    Use the properties of logarithms to combine all logs into one log.  Isolate the log on one side of the equation.  Convert the equation to exponential form.  Solve for the variable.  Check for extraneous solutions.     The natural base is an irrational number called , where   The natural exponential function is the function . The natural log function is the function .   Conversion Formulas for Natural Logs        Properties of Natural Logarithms  If , then     also     We use the natural logarithm to solve exponential equations with base .   Exponential Growth and Decay  The function describes exponential growth if , and exponential decay if .    Continuous compounding : The amount accumulated in an account after years at interest rate compounded continuously is given by where is the principal invested.  A log scale is useful for plotting values that vary greatly in magnitude. We plot the log of the variable, instead of the variable itself.  A log scale is a multiplicative scale : Each increment of equal length on the scale indicates that the value is multiplied by an equal amount.  The pH value of a substance is defined by the formula where denotes the concentration of hydrogen ions in the substance.  The loudness of a sound is measured in decibels, , by where is the intensity of its sound waves (in watts per square meter).  The Richter magnitude, , of an earthquake is given by where is the amplitude of its seismographic trace and is the amplitude of the smallest detectable earthquake.  A difference of units on a logarithmic scale corresponds to a factor of units in the value of the variable.  .     Chapter 5 Review Problems  For Problems 1 4, make a table of values for the inverse function.

  "body": " Factors and -Intercepts  In , perhaps you recognized the graph of the baseball's height as a parabola. In this chapter, we shall see that the graph of any quadratic function is a parabola.   Quadratic Function  A quadratic function quadratic function is one that can be written in the form where , , and are constants, and is not equal to zero.   In the definition above, notice that if is zero, there is no -squared term, so the function is not quadratic.  In , the height of a baseball seconds after being hit was given by We used a graph to find two times when the baseball was feet high. Can we solve the same problem algebraically?  We are looking for values of that produce in the height equation. So, if we substitute into the height equation, we would like to solve the quadratic equation  This equation cannot be solved by extraction of roots, because there are two terms containing the variable , and they cannot be combined. To solve this equation, we will appeal to a property of our number system, called the zero-factor principle .  Zero-Factor Principle  Can you multiply two numbers together and obtain a product of zero? Only if one of the two numbers happens to be zero. This property of numbers is called the zero-factor principle .   Zero-Factor Principle  The product of two factors equals zero if and only if one or both of the factors equals zero. In symbols,    The principle is true even if the numbers and are represented by algebraic expressions, such as or . For example, if then it must be true that either or . Thus, we can use the zero-factor principle to solve equations.   Solve the equation .  Find the -intercepts of the graph of .    We apply the zero-factor principle to the product . There are two solutions, and . (You should check that both of these values satisfy the original equation.)  To find the -intercepts of the graph, we set and solve the equation But this is the equation we solved in part (a), because . The solutions of that equation were and , so the -intercepts of the graph are and . You can see this by graphing the equation on your calculator, as shown below.  parabola with x-intercepts   illustrates an important fact about the -intercepts of a graph.   -Intercepts of a Graph  The -intercepts of the graph of are the solutions of the equation .   QuickCheck 1   What are the -intercepts of the graph of ?    and    and    and    and          and       Practice 1   Graph the function   on a calculator, and use your graph to solve the equation (Use  )  Solutions: [Separate different values with a comma.]  Check your answer with the zero-factor principle.               Pause and Reflect   How can you use a graph to factor a quadratic expression?        Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring  Before we apply the zero-factor principle to solve a quadratic equation, we must first write the equation so that one side of the equation is zero. Let us introduce some terminology.  Forms for Quadratic Equations   A quadratic equation written is in standard form standard form .  A quadratic equation written is in factored form factored form .   Once we have written the equation in standard form, we factor the left side and set each variable factor equal to zero separately. (See Appendix A.8 Factoring Quadratic Trinomials to review factoring.)  Solve  First, we write the equation in standard form. Next, we factor the left side to obtain We then apply the zero-factor principle by setting each factor equal to zero. Finally, we solve each equation to find The solutions are and .  When we apply the zero-factor principle, one side of the equation must be zero . For example, to solve the equation it is incorrect to set each factor equal to ! (There are many ways that the product of two numbers can equal ; it is not necessary that one of the numbers be .) We must first simplify the left side and write the equation in standard form. (The correct solutions are and ; make sure you can find these solutions.)  We summarize the factoring method for solving quadratic equations as follows.   To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring    Write the equation in standard form.  Factor the left side of the equation.  Apply the zero-factor principle: Set each factor equal to zero.  Solve each equation. There are two solutions (which may be equal).     Practice 2   Solve by factoring:  Solutions: [Separate different values with a comma.]        After rewriting the equation in standard form and then factoring, we find        We can use factoring to solve the equation from .  The height, , of a baseball seconds after being hit is given by When will the baseball reach a height of feet?  We substitute for in the formula, and solve for . There are two solutions to the quadratic equation. At seconds, the ball reaches a height of feet on the way up, and at seconds, the ball is feet high on its way down.  height of baseball   In the solution to , the factor does not affect the solutions of the equation at all. You can understand why this is true by looking at some graphs. First, check that the two equations have the same solutions, and . Then use your graphing calculator to graph the equation in the window Notice that when , or . These two points are the -intercepts of the graph. In the same window, now graph This graph has the same -values when . The factor of stretches the graph vertically but does not change the location of the -intercepts.  two parabolas with the same x-intercepts  QuickCheck 2   What happens to the -intercepts when you multiply the right side of by 3?    They are tripled.    They are divided by 3.    They move 3 units to the right.    They are unchanged.          They are unchanged.       The value of the constant factor in the factored form of a quadratic function, , does not affect the location of the -intercepts, because it does not affect the solutions of the equation .  Practice 3     Solve by factoring.  Solutions: [Separate different values with a comma.]    Solve by factoring.  Solutions: [Separate different values with a comma.]    Graph and together in the window   and locate the horizontal intercepts of each graph.  Horizontal intercepts: [Separate different ordered pairs with a comma.]                                       Pause and Reflect   Explain why the solutions of are not 3 and 6.        Applications  Here is another example of how quadratic equations arise in applications.    computer screen  The size of a rectangular computer monitor screen is given by the length of its diagonal, as shown at left. If the length of the screen should be inches greater than its width, what are the dimensions of a -inch monitor?  We express the two dimensions of the screen in terms of a single variable:   Width of screen:  Length of screen:   We can use the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation. Solve the equation. Begin by simplifying the left side. Because the width of the screen cannot be a negative number, we discard the solution . Thus, the width is inches, and the length is inches.  Practice 4  garden    Francine is designing the layout for a botanical garden. The plan includes a square herb garden, with a path 5 feet wide through the center of the garden, as shown above. To include all the species of herbs, the planted area must be 300 square feet. Find the dimensions of the herb garden.  Answer: feet by feet             20 feet by 20 feet       QuickCheck 3   If the perimeter of a rectangle is 56 inches and its width is inches, what is an expression for its length?                             Solutions of Quadratic Equations  We have seen that the solutions of the quadratic equation are and . Thus, if we know the two solutions of a quadratic equation, we can work backward and reconstruct the equation, starting from its factored form. We can then write the equation in standard form by multiplying together the factors.  Find a quadratic equation whose solutions are and .  The quadratic equation is To write the equation in standard form, we multiply the factors together. We can also find an equation with integer coefficients if we clear the equation of fractions. Multiply both sides by : You can check that the solutions of this last equation are in fact and . Multiplying both sides of an equation by a constant factor does not change its solutions.

A quadratic equation written as is in factored form .   To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring    Write the equation in standard form.  Factor the left side of the equation.  Apply the zero-factor principle: Set each factor equal to zero.  Solve each equation. There are two solutions (which may be equal).     Every quadratic equation has two solutions, which may be the same.  The value of the constant in the factored form of a quadratic equation does not affect the solutions.  Each solution of a quadratic equation corresponds to a factor in the factored form.  An equation is called quadratic in form if we can use a substitution to write it as , where stands for an algebraic expression.    STUDY QUESTIONS    Find a pair of numbers whose product is .

  "body": " Solving Quadratic Equations   Not every quadratic equation can be solved by factoring or by extraction of roots. For example, the expression cannot be factored, so the equation cannot be solved by factoring. For other equations, factoring may be difficult. In this section we learn two methods that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.  Squares of Binomials  In we used extraction of roots to solve equations of the form where the left side of the equation includes the square of a binomial, or a perfect square perfect square . We can write any quadratic equation in this form by completing the square .  Consider the following squares of binomials.   fig10 Square of binomial      1.      2.      3.      In each case, the square of the binomial is a quadratic trinomial, Note that the coefficient of the linear term, , is twice the constant in the binomial, and the constant term of the trinomial, , is its square.  QuickCheck 1   What is the linear term of ?                            We would like to reverse the process and write a quadratic expression as the square of a binomial. For example, what constant term can we add to to produce a perfect square trinomial? Compare the expression to the formula above: We see that and We substitute these values for and into the equation to find Notice that in the resulting trinomial, the constant term is equal to the square of one-half the coefficient of  . In other words, we can find the constant term by taking one-half the coefficient of and then squaring the result. Adding a constant term obtained in this way is called completing the square completing the square .  Complete the square by adding an appropriate constant; write the result as the square of a binomial.      One-half of is , so the constant term is , or . We add to obtain  One-half of is , so the constant term is , or . We add to obtain   You may find it helpful to visualize completing the square geometrically. We can think of the expression as the area of a rectangle with dimensions and . Here is an example.  The rectangle with length and width has area , as shown in figure (a).  We would like to cut the rectangle into pieces and rearrange them so that we can make a square.  In figure (b), we move half of the -term so that each side of the square has length (note that ).  In figure (c) we see that the missing corner piece has area .   completing the square  Practice 1   Complete the square by adding an appropriate constant; write the result as the square of a binomial.            For part (a): _____ , ______  For part (b): _____ , ______                                     Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square completing the square  Now we will use completing the square to solve quadratic equations. First, we will solve equations in which the coefficient of the squared term is 1. Consider the equation and follow the steps to find the solutions.  Step 1  Begin by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation, to get  Step 2  Now complete the square on the left. Because we add to both sides of our equation to get  Step 3  The left side of the equation is now the square of a binomial, namely . We write the left side in its square form and simplify the right side, which gives us (You can check that this equation is equivalent to the original one; if you expand the left side and collect like terms, you will return to the original equation.)  Step 4  We can now use extraction of roots to find the solutions. Taking square roots of both sides, we get The solutions are and .   parabola  The graph of is shown in at left. Note that the -intercepts of the graph are and , and the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line halfway between the intercepts, at .  We can also solve by factoring instead of completing the square. Of course, we get the same solutions by either method. In , we will solve an equation that cannot be solved by factoring.  Solve by completing the square.    First, write the equation with the constant term on the right side.  Now complete the square on the left side. The coefficient of is , so We add to both sides of our equation:  Write the left side as the square of a binomial, and combine terms on the right side:  Finally, use extraction of roots to obtain   The solutions are and . The graph of is shown below.    parabola showing x-intercepts and line of symmetry     QuickCheck 2   What should we add to to create a perfect square?

The General Case  Our method for completing the square works only if the coefficient of is . If we want to solve a quadratic equation whose lead coefficient is not , we first divide each term of the equation by the lead coefficient.  Solve .   Because the coefficient of is , we must divide each term of the equation by . Now we proceed as before. Rewrite the equation with the constant on the right side.  Complete the square: Add to both sides of our equation:  Rewrite the left side as the square of a binomial and simplify the right side to get  Finally, extract roots and solve each equation for . The solutions are and .  Using a calculator, we can find decimal approximations for the solutions: and .   In the Example above , it is essential that we first divide each term of the equation by the coefficient of . The following attempt at a solution is incorrect . You can check that is not equal to . We have not written the left side of the equation as a perfect square, so the solutions we obtain by extracting roots will not be correct.  QuickCheck 3   What is the first step in solving ?

To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square       Write the equation in standard form.    Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the quadratic term, and subtract the constant term from both sides.      Complete the square on the left side:  Multiply the coefficient of the first-degree term by one-half, then square the result.  Add the value obtained in (a) to both sides of the equation.     Write the left side of the equation as the square of a binomial. Simplify the right side.    Use extraction of roots to finish the solution.      Pause and Reflect   How does creating the square of a binomial help us solve a quadratic equation?        Quadratic Formula quadratic formula  Instead of completing the square every time we solve a new quadratic equation, we can complete the square on the general quadratic equation, and obtain a formula for the solutions of any quadratic equation.   The Quadratic Formula  The solutions of the equation , are    QuickCheck 4   Does ? Why or why not?    No, it should be .    Yes, we take the square root of each term.    No, we cannot take the square root of a negative number.    No, .          No,       This formula expresses the solutions of a quadratic equation in terms of its coefficients. (The proof of the formula is considered in the Homework problems.) The symbol , read \"plus or minus,\" is used to combine the two equations into a single equation.  Notice that the two solutions can be written as These expressions show us again that the -intercepts of the graph of lie an equal distance on either side of the vertical line , which is the axis of symmetry of the parabola. We'll consider these facts more fully in the next section, Graphing Parabolas.  To solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, all we have to do is substitute the coefficients , , and into the formula.  Solve .  Write the equation in standard form as Substitute for , for , and for into the quadratic formula, then simplify. (See Appendix A.8 Working with Radicals , to review simplifying radicals.) Using a calculator, we find that the solutions are approximately and .  We can also verify that the -intercepts of the graph of are approximately and , as shown below.  parabola with irrational x-intercepts  Practice 4   Use the quadratic formula to solve  Solutions:              Note that the solutions to this equation are the same as the solutions we found in .  Pause and Reflect   How can you decide which of the four methods for solving a quadratic equation you should use?        Applications  We have now seen four different algebraic methods for solving quadratic equations:  Factoring  Extraction of roots  Completing the square  Quadratic formula  Factoring and extraction of roots are relatively fast and simple, but they do not work on all quadratic equations. The quadratic formula will work on any quadratic equation.  QuickCheck 5   What is wrong with this statement of the quadratic formula?    Nothing.    We should simplify the radical.    should be over .

They have feet of picket fence and would like the total area of the playground to be square feet. Can they enclose the playground with the fence they have, and if so, what should the dimensions of the playground be?  two fenced rectangles against wall   Suppose the width of the play area is feet. Because there are three sections of fence along the width of the play area, that leaves feet of fence for its length. The area of the play area should be square feet, so we have the equation This is a quadratic equation. In standard form, The left side cannot be factored, so we use the quadratic formula with , , and . Simplifying the last fraction, we find that or . Both values give solutions to the problem.  If the width of the play area is feet, then the length is , or feet.  If the width is feet, the length is , or feet.

The Quadratic Formula  The solutions of the equation , are    We have four methods for solving quadratic equations: extracting of roots, factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula.

  "body": " Graphing Parabolas  Introduction  The graph of a quadratic function is called a parabola parabola . Some parabolas are shown below.  two parabolas with labeled features  All these parabolas share certain features.  The graph has either a highest point (if the parabola opens downward, as in figure (a) or a lowest point (if the parabola opens upward, as in figure (b). This high or low point is called the vertex vertex of the graph.  The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line, called the axis of symmetry axis of symmetry , that runs through the vertex.  The -intercept is the point where the parabola intersects the -axis. The graph of a quadratic function always has exactly one - intercept intercept .  However, the graph may cross the -axis at one point, at two points, or not at all. Points where the parabola intersects the -axis are called the - intercepts . If there are two -intercepts, they are equidistant from the axis of symmetry.  The values of the constants , , and determine the location and orientation of the parabola. We will begin by considering each of these constants separately.   QuickCheck 1   Which point on a parabola always lies on the axis of symmetry?

To make a reasonable sketch by hand, it is enough to plot a few guidepoints ; the points with -coordinates and are easy to compute.   two vertically scaled parabolas                    We sketch parabolas through each set of guidepoints, as shown at left.

We can find the -intercepts of the graph by setting equal to zero: The solutions of this equation are and , so the -intercepts are the points and .  Recall that the parabola is symmetric about a vertical line through its vertex. (We will prove that this is true in the Homework problems.) The two -intercepts are equidistant from this line of symmetry, so the -coordinate of the vertex lies exactly halfway between the -intercepts. We can average their values to find To find the -coordinate of the vertex, substitute into the equation for the parabola: Thus, the vertex is the point .

Finally, we find the -coordinate of the vertex by substituting its -coordinate into the equation for the parabola.   Find the vertex of the graph of .  Find the -intercepts of the graph.

The Graph of  Now we will see that the vertex formula holds for any parabola. Consider the function   Adding to shifts each point on the graph units upward, as shown at right. The -coordinate of the vertex will not be affected by an upward shift. Thus, the formula for the -coordinate of the vertex still holds. We have   We find the -coordinate of the vertex by substituting into the equation for the parabola. So the vertex is the point . (Notice that this point is shifted units upward from the vertex of .)  We find the -intercepts of the graph by setting equal to zero. The -intercepts are the points and .  The -intercept of the graph is found by setting equal to zero: You can see that the -intercept, , is just the constant term of the quadratic equation. The completed graph is shown above.

Alternatively, we can use the calculator to evaluate for . The calculator returns the -value . Thus, the vertex is the point , which is the decimal equivalent of .   Practice 4   Find the vertex of the graph of  Decide whether the vertex is a maximum point or a minimum point of the graph.   maximum    minimum               minimum        Number of -Intercepts  The graph of the quadratic function may have two, one, or no -intercepts, according to the number of distinct real-valued solutions of the equation . Consider the three functions graphed below.  parabolas with zero, one, or two x-intercepts    The graph of has two -intercepts, because the equation has two real-valued solutions, and .  The graph of has only one -intercept, because the equation has only one (repeated) real-valued solution, .  The graph of has no -intercepts, because the equation has no real-valued solutions.   A closer look at the quadratic formula reveals useful information about the solutions of quadratic equations. For the three functions above, we have the following:  discriminant for the three cases  The expression , which appears under the radical in the quadratic formula, is called the discriminant discriminant , , of the equation. The value of the discriminant determines the nature of the solutions of the equation. In particular, if the discriminant is negative, the solutions of the quadratic equation are complex numbers complex number . (We will study complex numbers in .)   The Discriminant  The discriminant discriminant of a quadratic equation is .  If , there are two unequal real solutions.  If , there is one real solution of multiplicity two.  If , there are two complex solutions.     We can also use the discriminant to decide whether a quadratic equation can be solved by factoring. First, clear the equation of fractions. If the discriminant is a perfect square, that is, the square of an integer, the solutions are rational numbers. This in turn means that the equation can be solved by factoring.  If the discriminant is not a perfect square, the solutions will be irrational. Irrational solutions always occur in conjugate pairs, The only difference between the two solutions is the sign between the terms. For example, if we know that one solution of a particular quadratic equation is , then the other solution must be .  Use the discriminant to determine the nature of the solutions of each equation. Can the equation be solved by factoring?       . The equation has two real, unequal solutions. Because is not a perfect square, the solutions will be irrational numbers, so the equation cannot be solved by factoring.  . The equation has two complex solutions, which cannot be found by factoring.  . The equation has two real, unequal solutions. Because , the solutions are rational numbers and can be found by factoring.  (You can verify the conclusions above by solving each equation.)  Practice 5   Use the discriminant to discover how many -intercepts the graph of each function has.       None    1    2    Other         None    1    2    Other                   None: the discriminant is negative.    One: the discriminant is 0.         In , you should check that the single -intercept is also the vertex of the parabola.  Pause and Reflect   Explain what the discriminant tells us about a quadratic equation.        Sketching a Parabola  Once we have located the vertex of the parabola, the -intercepts, and the -intercept, we can sketch a reasonably accurate graph. Recall that the graph should be symmetric about a vertical line through the vertex. We summarize the procedure as follows.   To Graph the Quadratic Function :    Determine whether the parabola opens upward (if ) or downward (if ).  Locate the vertex of the parabola.  The -coordinate of the vertex is .  Find the -coordinate of the vertex by substituting into the equation of the parabola.    Locate the -intercepts (if any) by setting and solving for .  Locate the -intercept by evaluating for .  Locate the point symmetric to the -intercept across the axis of symmetry.     Sketch a graph of the equation , showing the significant points.  We follow the steps outlined above.  Because , we know that the parabola opens upward.  We compute the coordinates of the vertex: The vertex is the point .  We set equal to zero to find the -intercepts. Rounding to the nearest tenth, we find that the -intercepts are approximately and .  We substitute to find the -intercept, .  The axis of symmetry is the vertical line , so the -intercept lies units to the right of the axis of symmetry.  There must be another point on the parabola with the same -coordinate as the -intercept but units to the left of the axis of symmetry. The coordinates of this point are .  Finally, plot the -intercepts, the vertex, and the -intercept and its symmetric point, and draw a parabola through them.

  "body": " Problem Solving   Many quadratic models arise as the product of two variables, one of which increases while the other decreases. For example, the area of a rectangle is the product of its length and its width, or . If we require that the rectangle have a certain perimeter, then as we increase its length, we must also decrease its width. (We analyzed this problem in of .)  For , recall the formula for the revenue from sales of an item: Usually, when the price of an item increases, the number of items sold decreases.  Revenue from Theater Tickets  The local theater group sold tickets to its opening night performance for and drew an audience of people. The next night, the group reduced the ticket price by and more people attended; that is, people bought tickets at apiece. In fact, for each reduction in ticket price, additional tickets can be sold.  Complete the table.    Number of price reductions  Price of ticket  Number of tickets sold  Total revenue                                                                    Use your table to make a graph.

Write algebraic expressions in terms of for each quantity.  The price of a ticket after price reductions:  The number of tickets sold at that price:  The total revenue from ticket sales:  Enter your expressions for the price of a ticket, the number of tickets sold, and the total revenue into the calculator as , , and . Use the Table feature to verify that your algebraic expressions agree with your table from part (1).  Use your calculator to graph your expression for total revenue in terms of . Use your table to choose appropriate window settings that show the high point of the graph and both xintercepts.  What is the maximum revenue possible from ticket sales? What price should the theater group charge for a ticket to generate that revenue? How many tickets will the group sell at that price?    Maximum or Minimum Values  Finding the maximum or minimum value for a variable expression is a common problem in many applications. For example, if you own a company that manufactures blue jeans, you might like to know how much to charge for your jeans in order to maximize your revenue.  As you increase the price of the jeans, your revenue may increase for a while. But if you charge too much for the jeans, consumers will not buy as many pairs, and your revenue may actually start to decrease. Is there some optimum price you should charge for a pair of jeans in order to achieve the greatest revenue?  Late Nite Blues finds that it can sell pairs of jeans per week if it charges dollars per pair. (Notice that as the price increases, the number of pairs of jeans sold decreases.)  Write an equation for the revenue as a function of the price of a pair of jeans.  Graph the function.  How much should Late Nite Blues charge for a pair of jeans in order to maximize its revenue?    Using the formula for revenue stated above, we find  We recognize the function as quadratic, so the graph is a parabola. You can use your calculator to verify the graph below.  graph showing revenue from sales of jeans  The maximum value of occurs at the vertex of the parabola. Thus, The revenue takes on its maximum value when , and the maximum value is . This means that Late Nite Blues should charge $ for a pair of jeans in order to maximize revenue at $ a week.   The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function is easy to find: It is the value at the vertex. If the parabola opens downward, as in , there is a maximum value at the vertex. If the parabola opens upward, there is a minimum value at the vertex.  QuickCheck 1   The height of golf ball in meters is given by What does the vertex of the graph tell us about the golf ball?

The Vertex Form for a Parabola  QuickCheck 2   What is the -coordinate of the vertex of the parabola ?                            Consider the quadratic equation By expanding the squared expression and collecting like terms, we can rewrite the equation in standard form as The vertex of this parabola is and its graph is shown below.  parabola with vertex labeled  Notice that the coordinates of the vertex, , are apparent in the original equation; we don’t need to do any computation to find the vertex. This equation is an example of the vertex form vertex form for a quadratic function.   Vertex Form for a Quadratic Function  A quadratic function , , can be written in the vertex form where the vertex of the graph is .   Find the vertex of the graph of . Is the vertex a maximum or a minimum point of the graph?  Compare the equation to the vertex form to see that the coordinates of the vertex are . For this equation, , so the parabola opens downward. The vertex is the maximum point of the graph.  To understand why the vertex form works, substitute into from to find which confirms that when , . Next, notice that if is any number except , the expression is negative, so . Therefore, is the maximum value for on the graph, so is the high point or vertex.  You can also rewrite in standard form and use the formula to confirm that the vertex is the point .  Practice 2     Find the vertex of the graph of  Vertex:    Write the equation of the parabola in standard form.

We can't tell without graphing                Any quadratic equation in vertex form can be written in standard form by expanding, and any quadratic equation in standard form can be put into vertex form by completing the square.  Write the equation in vertex form and find the vertex of its graph.  We factor the lead coefficient, , from the variable terms, leaving a space to complete the square. Next, we complete the square inside parentheses. Take half the coefficient of and square the result: . We must add to complete the square. However, we are really adding to the right side of the equation, so we must also subtract to compensate: The expression inside parentheses is now a perfect square, and the vertex form is The vertex of the parabola is .

Pause and Reflect   Why do we need to know a second point besides the vertex to find the equation of a parabola?        Graphing with the Vertex Form  We can also use the vertex form to sketch a graph, using what we know about transformations.  Use transformations to graph .   We can graph by applying transformations to the basic parabola, . To identify the transformations, think of evaluating the function for a specific value of .

The Pizza Connection calculates that the cost, in dollars, of producing pizzas per day is given by The Pizza Connection charges $ per pizza, so the revenue from selling pizzas is How many pizzas per day must the Pizza Connection sell in order to break even?  To break even means to make zero profit. Because the break-even points occur when revenue equals cost. In mathematical terms, we would like to find any values of for which .  If we graph the revenue and cost functions on the same axes, these values correspond to points where the two graphs intersect. Use the window settings on your calculator to obtain the graph shown below. You can verify that the two intersection points are and .  GC figure for quadratic system  Thus, the Pizza Connection must sell either or pizzas in order to break even. On the graph we see that revenue is greater than cost for -values between and , so the Pizza Connection will make a profit if it sells between and pizzas.  We can also solve algebraically for the break-even points. The intersection points of the two graphs correspond to the solutions of the system of equations We equate the two expressions for and solve for :  The solutions are and , as we found from the graph.  Practice 5     Solve the system algebraically:   Solutions: Note: list solutions as ordered pairs, and use a comma to separate solutions.

Solving Systems with the Graphing Calculator  We can use the intersect feature of the graphing calculator to solve systems of quadratic equations. Consider the system We will graph these two equations in the standard window. The two intersection points are visible in the window, but we do not find their exact coordinates when we trace the graphs.  We can use the intersect command to locate one of the solutions, as shown below. You can check that the point is an exact solution to the system by substituting and into each equation of the system. (The calculator is not always able to find the exact coordinates, but it usually gives a very good approximation.)  GC graph showing quadratic system  You can find the other solution of the system by following the same steps and moving the bug close to the other intersection point. You should verify that the other solution is the point .    Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

The graphing technique is especially helpful for solving quadratic inequalities.  The Chamber of Commerce in River City plans to put on a Fourth of July fireworks display. City regulations require that fireworks at public gatherings explode higher than feet above the ground. The mayor particularly wants to include the Freedom Starburst model, which is launched from the ground. Its height after t seconds is given by When should the Starburst explode in order to satisfy the safety regulation?  We can get an approximate answer to this question by looking at the graph of the rocket's height, shown below.  graph of fireworks height   When is the rocket's height greater than 800 feet, or, in mathematical terms, for what values of is ? The answer to this question is the solution of the inequality Points on the graph with are shown in color, and the -coordinates of those points are marked on the horizontal axis. If the Freedom Starburst explodes at any of these times, it will satisfy the safety regulation.   From the graph, the safe time interval runs from approximately seconds to seconds after launch. The solution of the inequality is the set of all -values greater than but less than .  The solution set in is called a compound inequality compound inequality , because it involves more than one inequality symbol. We write this set as and read \" greater than but less than .\"  QuickCheck 1   What are the solutions of the inequality ?

If one side of an inequality is zero, we can compare points on the graph with the line , which is the -axis.  Consider the graph of . Find the solutions of the following equations and inequalities.      Look at the graph of shown below. When we substitute a value of into the expression , the result is either positive, negative, or zero.   (You can see this more clearly if you compute a few values yourself to complete the table below. Your table should agree with the coordinates of points on the graph.)                      We will use the graph to solve the given equation and inequalities.  parabola dividing x-axis into 3 regions   First, locate the two points on the graph where . These points are and . Their -coordinates, and , are the solutions of the equation . The two points divide the -axis into three sections, which are labeled on the graph. On each of these sections, the value of is either always positive or always negative.  To solve , find the points on the graph where , that is, below the -axis. These points have -coordinates between and (labeled section II on the figure). Thus, the solution to the inequality is .  To solve , locate the points on the graph where , or above the -axis. Points with positive -values correspond to two sections of the -axis, labeled I and III on the figure. In section I, , and in section III, . Thus, the solution to the inequality includes all values of for which either or .

The -intercepts    The -intercept    The vertex    All of these          The -intercepts       Because it is relatively easy to decide whether the -coordinate of a point on a graph is positive or negative (the point lies above the -axis or below the x-axis), we often rewrite a given inequality so that one side is zero.  Use a graph to solve  We first write the inequality with zero on one side: . We would like to find points on the graph of that have -coordinates less than or equal to zero. A graph of the equation is shown below.   You can check that the -intercepts of the graph are and . The points shown in red on the graph lie below the -axis and have , so the -coordinates of these points are the solutions of the inequality. All of these points have -coordinates between and .

Solving Quadratic Inequalities Algebraically  Although a graph is very helpful in solving inequalities, it is not completely necessary. Every quadratic inequality can be put into one of the forms All we really need to know is whether the corresponding parabola opens upward or downward. Consider the parabolas shown below.  parabola opens up, the other opens down  The parabola in figure (a) opens upward. It crosses the -axis at two points, and . At these points, .   The graph lies below the -axis between and , so the solutions to the inequality lie between and .  The graph lies above the -axis for -values less than or greater than , so the solutions to the inequality are or .   If the parabola opens downward, as in figure (b), the situation is reversed. The solutions to the inequality lie between the -intercepts, and the solutions to lie outside the -intercepts.  From the graphs, we see that the -intercepts are the boundary points between the portions of the graph with positive -coordinates and the portions with negative -coordinates. To solve a quadratic inequality, we need only locate the -intercepts of the corresponding graph and then decide which intervals of the -axis produce the correct sign for .   To Solve a Quadratic Inequality Algebraically:    Write the inequality in standard form: One side is , and the other has the form .   Find the -intercepts of the graph of by setting and solving for .  Make a rough sketch of the graph, using the sign of to determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward.  Decide which intervals on the -axis give the correct sign for .     Solve the inequality algebraically.    We subtract from both sides of the inequality so that we have on the right side.  Consider the equation . To locate the -intercepts, we set and solve for . The -intercepts are and .  Make a rough sketch of the graph of , as shown below. Because , the graph is a parabola that opens downward.  parabola opening down dividing x-axis into 3 parts  We are interested in points on the graph for which . The points with negative -coordinates (that is, points below the -axis) lie outside the -intercepts of the graph, so the solution of the inequality is or . Or, using interval notation, the solution is .   QuickCheck 3   Why do we need to know whether tha parabola in QuickCheck 2 opens up or down?    To decide whether to use or in the solution.    To decide whether the solutions lie between the -intercepts or outside them.    To decide whether the solutions are positive or negative.    To help us find the -intercepts.          To decide whether the solutions lie between the -intercepts or outside them.       Many people think that the inequality signs in the solution should point in the same direction as the sign in the original problem, and hence would incorrectly write the solution to as or . However, you can see from the graph that this is incorrect. Remember that the graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola, not a straight line!  Practice 4   Solve  Answer:     Write the inequality in standard form.    Find the -intercepts of the corresponding graph. Use extraction of roots.    Make a rough sketch of the graph.

If the data points do not cluster around a line, it does not make sense to describe them by a linear function. Compare the scatterplots shown below.  scatterplot that is linear and another that falls on a parabola  The points in figure (a) are roughly linear in appearance, but the points in figure (b) are not. However, we can visualize a parabola that would approximate the data. In this section, we will see how to fit a quadratic function to a collection of data points.  We will need to solve a special type of linear system, that is, a linear system of three equations in three variables. We can solve these systems using the elimination elimination method. See Appendix to review the elimination method.  Use elimination to solve the system of equations.   We first eliminate from the system by combining the equations in pairs. We can add times Equation (2) to Equation (1) to get a new equation in two variables:                                  Next, we add times Equation (2) to Equation (3) to get a second equation in two variables:                                  By combining Equations (4) and (5), we have a linear system, which we can solve as usual. To eliminate , we add times Equation (5) to Equation (4):                           Solving this last equation gives us . Then we substitute into either of Equations (4) or (5) to find . Finally, we substitute both values into one of the three original equations to find . The solution of the system is , , .  Practice 1   Follow the steps to solve the system     Eliminate from Equations (1) and (2) to obtain a new Equation (4).    Eliminate from Equations (2) and (3) to obtain a new Equation (5).    Solve the system of Equations (4) and (5).  ,    Substitute the values of and into one of the original equations to find                                                    Finding a Quadratic Function through Three Points  Every linear function can be written in the form To find a specific line, we must find values for the two parameters (constants) and . We need two data points in order to find those two parameters. A quadratic function, however, has three parameters, , , and : To find these parameters, we need three data points. We then use the method of elimination to solve a system of three linear equations.  Find values for , , and so that the points , , and lie on the graph of .  We substitute the coordinates of each of the three points into the equation of the parabola to obtain three equations: or, equivalently, This is a system of three equations in the three unknowns , , and . To solve the system, we first eliminate . Add times Equation (1) to Equation (2) to obtain and add times Equation (1) to Equation (3) to get We now have a system of two linear equations in two variables: We eliminate from Equations (4) and (5): Add times Equation (4) to times Equation (5) to get                            or . We substitute for in Equation (4) to find Finally, we substitute for and for in Equation (1) to find Thus, the equation of the parabola is The parabola and the three points are shown below.  parabola through-3 specified points  QuickCheck 1   When we solve a system to fit a parabola through three points, which variable should we eliminate first?

A graph is below.         parabola   The simplest way to fit a parabola to a set of data points is to pick three of the points and find the equation of the parabola that passes through those three points.  Major Motors Corporation is testing a new car designed for in-town driving. The data below show the cost of driving the car at different speeds. The speeds, , are given in miles per hour, and the cost, , includes fuel and maintenance for driving the car miles at that speed.                  Find a possible quadratic model for as a function of , .  When we plot the data, it is clear that the relationship between and is not linear, but it may be quadratic, as shown at right.  We will use the last three data points, , , and , to fit a parabola to the data. We would like to find the coefficients , , and of a parabola that includes the three data points. This gives us a system of equations:  scatterplot points following parabola shape   Eliminating from Equations (1) and (2) yields Equation (4), and eliminating from Equations (2) and (3) yields Equation (5). Eliminating from Equations (4) and (5) gives us  We substitute this value into Equation (4) to find , then substitute both values into Equation (1) to find . Thus, our quadratic model is The graph of this function, along with the data points, is shown at right.  parabola fitting nonlinear scatterplot  Practice 3   Sara plans to start a side business selling eggs. She finds that the total number of eggs produced each day depends on the number of hens confined in the henhouse, as shown in the table.

Finding an Equation in Vertex Form  It is easier to find a quadratic model if one of the points we know happens to be the vertex of the parabola. In that case, we need only one other point, and we can use the vertex form to find its equation.  When Andre practices free-throws at the park, the ball leaves his hands at a height of feet and reaches the vertex of its trajectory feet away at a height of feet, as shown at right.  basketball path on grid  Find a quadratic function for the ball's trajectory.  Do you think Andre's free-throw will score on a basketball court where the hoop is feet from the shooter and feet high?    If Andre's feet are at the origin, then the vertex of the ball's trajectory is the point , and its -intercept is . Start with the vertex form for a parabola: We still need to know the value of . We can substitute the coordinates of any point on the parabola for and and solve for . We will use the point : The equation of the trajectory is .  We would like to know if the point is on the trajectory of Andre's free-throw. Substitute into the equation: Andre's shot will score.

For each fountain, water emerges in a parabolic arc from a nozzle feet above the ground. Francine would like the vertex of the arc to be feet high and feet horizontally from the nozzle.    Choose a coordinate system for the diagram below and write a function for the path of the water.  With the origin on the ground directly below the nozzle,  Use to represent the horizontal distance from the origin.    How far from the base of the nozzle will the stream of water hit the ground?  Answer: feet                 With the origin on the ground directly below the nozzle,    Approximately feet         Using a Calculator for Quadratic Regression  We can use a graphing calculator to find an approximate quadratic fit for a set of data.

How many of the given data points actually lie on the graph of the quadratic approximation?    We press STAT  ENTER and enter the data under columns and , as shown below. Next, we calculate the quadratic regression equation and store it in by pressing STAT    VARS     ENTER .  The regression equation has the form , where , , and . Notice that , , and are all close to the values we computed in .  GC lists and GC quadratic regression output  Next, we will graph the data and the regression equation. We press Y= and select Plot1 , then press ZOOM  to see the graph shown below. The parabola seems to pass close to all the data points.  However, try using either the value feature or a table to find the -coordinates of points on the regression curve. By comparing these -coordinates with our original data points, we find that none of the given data points lies precisely on the parabola.

The graph appears to be quadratic.            parabola fit to points   QuickCheck 3   How many data points must a quadratic regression graph pass through?    One    Two    Three    None          None       We must be careful that our data set gives a complete picture of the situation we want to model. A regression equation may fit a particular collection of data and still be a poor model if the rest of the data diverge from the regression graph.   GC graph showing a poor linear fit for quadratic data  In , suppose Major Motors had collected only the first three data points and fit a line through them, as shown at left. This regression line gives poor predictions for the cost of driving at 60 or 70 miles per hour.   Francine records the height of the tip of the minute hand on the classroom’s clock at different times. The data are shown in the table, where time is measured in minutes since noon. (A negative time indicates a number of minutes before noon.) Find a quadratic regression equation for the data and use it to predict the height of the minute hand's tip at minutes past noon. Do you believe this prediction is valid?    Time (minutes)              Height (feet)              We enter the time data under and the height data under . Then we calculate and store the quadratic regression equation in , as we did in . The regression equation is From either the graph of the regression equation or from the table (see figure below), we can see that the fit is not perfect, although the curve certainly fits the data better than any straight line could.  GC screens of graph and tables for quadratic fit  If we scroll down the table, we find that this equation predicts a height of approximately feet at time minutes. (See figure (c).) This is a preposterous estimate! The position of the minute hand at minutes after noon should be the same as it was exactly one hour earlier (at 20 minutes before noon), when it was feet.  Using the wrong type of function to fit the data is a common error in making predictions. We know that the minute hand of a clock repeats its position every minutes. The graph of the height of its tip oscillates up and down, repeating the same pattern over and over. We cannot describe such a graph using either a linear or a quadratic function.   parabola fit on part of a periodic wave  The graph of the height is shown at left, along with the graph of our quadratic regression equation. You can see that the regression equation fits the actual curve only on a small interval.   Your calculator can always compute a regression equation, but that equation is not necessarily appropriate for your data. Choosing a reasonable type of regression equation for a particular data set requires knowledge of different kinds of models and the physical or natural laws that govern the situation at hand.  QuickCheck 4   Which statement is true?    A) A parabola is a good model for any non-linear curve.    B) We will get the same equation by fitting a parabola through any three points of a data set.    C) We can use elimination to fit a parabola through three points.    D) When we use quadratic regression, the lowest (or highest) point of a data set will be the vertex of the parabola.          We can use elimination to fit a parabola through three points.       Practice 6   A speeding motorist slams on the brakes when she sees an accident directly ahead of her.

In the 1990s, an outbreak of mad cow disease (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) alarmed health officials in England. The table shows the number of deaths each year from the disease.    Year  '94  '95  '96  '97  '98  '99  2000  '01  '02  '03  '04   Deaths             (Source: www.cjd.ed.ac.uk\/vcjdqsep05)  The Health Protection Agency determined that a quadratic model was the best-fitting model for the data. Find a quadratic regression equation for the data.  Use your model to estimate when the peak of the epidemic occurred and how many deaths from mad cow disease were expected in 2005.    The predicted peak was in 2000, near the end of March. The model predicts deaths for 2005.   The table shows the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to a crop of soybeans per hectare of land in a trial in Thailand and the resulting yield.    Nitrogen (kg)        Yield (tons)       (Source: www.arc-avrdc.org)  Fit a quadratic regression equation to the data.  Use your model to predict the maximum yield and the amount of nitrogen needed.   The number of daylight hours increases each day from the beginning of winter until the beginning of summer, and then begins to decrease.

Zero-Factor Principle  The product of two factors equals zero if and only if one or both of the factors equals zero. In symbols,    The -intercepts of the graph of are the solutions of the equation .  A quadratic equation written as is in standard form .  A quadratic equation written as is in factored form .   To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring    Write the equation in standard form.  Factor the left side of the equation.  Apply the zero-factor principle: Set each factor equal to zero.  Solve each equation. There are two solutions (which may be equal).     Every quadratic equation has two solutions, which may be the same.  The value of the constant in the factored form of a quadratic equation does not affect the solutions.  Each solution of a quadratic equation corresponds to a factor in the factored form.  An equation is called quadratic in form if we can use a substitution to write it as , where stands for an algebraic expression.  The square of the binomial is a quadratic trinomial ,    To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square       Write the equation in standard form.    Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the quadratic term, and subtract the constant term from both sides.      Complete the square on the left side:  Multiply the coefficient of the first-degree term by one-half, then square the result.  Add the value obtained in (a) to both sides of the equation.     Write the left side of the equation as the square of a binomial. Simplify the right side.    Use extraction of roots to finish the solution.       The Quadratic Formula  The solutions of the equation , are    We have four methods for solving quadratic equations: extracting roots, factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula. The first two methods are faster, but they do not work on all equations. The last two methods work on any quadratic equation.  The graph of a quadratic function is called a parabola . The values of the constants , , and determine the location and orientation of the parabola.  For the graph of , the -coordinate of the vertex is .  To find the -coordinate of the vertex, we substitute into the formula for the parabola.  The graph of the quadratic function may have two, one, or no -intercepts, according to the number of distinct real-valued solutions of the equation .   The Discriminant  The discriminant discriminant of a quadratic equation is .  If , there are two unequal real solutions.  If , there is one real solution of multiplicity two.  If , there are two complex solutions.      To Graph the Quadratic Function :    Determine whether the parabola opens upward (if ) or downward (if ).  Locate the vertex of the parabola.  The -coordinate of the vertex is .  Find the -coordinate of the vertex by substituting into the equation of the parabola.    Locate the -intercepts (if any) by setting and solving for .  Locate the -intercept by evaluating for .  Locate the point symmetric to the -intercept across the axis of symmetry.     Quadratic models may arise as the product of two variables.  The maximum or minimum of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex.   Vertex Form for a Quadratic Function  A quadratic function , , can be written in the vertex form where the vertex of the graph is .   We can convert a quadratic equation to vertex form by completing the square.  We can graph a quadratic equation in vertex form using transformations.  A system involving quadratic equations may have one, two, or no solutions.  We can use a graphical technique to solve quadratic inequalities.   To Solve a Quadratic Inequality Algebraically:    Write the inequality in standard form: One side is , and the other has the form .   Find the -intercepts of the graph of by setting and solving for .  Make a rough sketch of the graph, using the sign of to determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward.  Decide which intervals on the -axis give the correct sign for .     We need three points to determine the equation of a parabola.  We can use the method of elimination to find the equation of a parabola through three points.  If we know the vertex of a parabola, we need only one other point to find its equation.  We can use quadratic regression to fit a parabola to a collection of data points.  .     Chapter 6 Review Problems  For Problems 1-6, solve by factoring.         For Problems 7-8, write a quadratic equation with integer coefficients and with the given solutions.  and  and   For Problems 9-10, graph the equation using the ZDecimal setting.

If the flock is too small, the birds are nervous and spend a lot of time watching for predators.

In general, we make the following definition.  Polynomial Function  A polynomial function polynomial function has the form where , , , , are constants and . The coefficient of the highest power term is called the lead coefficient lead coefficient .  Some examples of polynomials are  Each of the polynomials above is written in descending powers descending powers , which means that the highest-degree term comes first, and the degrees of the terms decrease from largest to smallest. Sometimes it is useful to write a polynomial in ascending powers ascending powers , so that the degrees of the terms increase. For example, the polynomial above would be written as in ascending powers.  QuickCheck 1   What is the lead coefficient of a polynomial?

To compute the fourth-degree term in the product, we multiply a term of of degree 4, 3, 2, or 0 by a term of of degree 0, 1, 2, or 4 respectively.

Factoring the Sum or Difference of Two Cubes             When we recognize a polynomial as a sum or difference of two perfect cubes, we then identify the two cubed expressions and apply the formula.

Cubic polynomials are often used in economics to model cost functions. The cost of producing items is an increasing function of , but its rate of increase is usually not constant.

Graph the cost function in the window below and describe the graph.  How many copies can be printed for $1200?  What does the concavity of the graph tell you about the cost function?    Fixed costs are given by , or $ . The fixed costs include expenses like utility bills that must be paid even if no magazines are produced.  The graph is shown in figure (a). It is increasing from a vertical intercept of . The graph is concave down for approximately, and concave up for .  GC graphs of a cubic cost function  We must solve the equation We will solve the equation graphically, as shown in figure (b). Graph along with the cost function, and use the intersect command to find the intersection point of the graphs, . when is about , so copies can be printed for $ .  Although the cost is always increasing, it increases very slowly from about to about . The flattening of the graph in this interval is a result of economy of scale: By buying supplies in bulk and using time efficiently, the cost per magazine can be minimized. However, if the production level is too large, costs begin to rise rapidly again.   In c, we solved a cubic equation graphically. There is a cubic formula, analogous to the quadratic formula, that allows us to solve cubic equations algebraically, but it is complicated and not often used. See the Projects for Chapter 7 if you would like to know more about the cubic formula.  QuickCheck 5   How do we solve cubic equations in this class?    By factoring.    By taking cube roots.    By using the quadratic formula.    By graphing.          By graphing.       Cubic polynomials are also used to model smooth curves connecting given points. Such a curve is called a cubic spline .

A typical response function is where is the amount of fertilizer, in kilograms per acre.(Source: Beattie, Mortensen, and Knudsen, 2005)  Graph the function on the domain .  Describe the concavity of the graph. In reality, the yield does not increase after reaching its plateau. Give a suitable domain for the model in this application.  Estimate the maximum yield attainable and the optimum application of fertilizer.   During an earthquake, Nordhoff Street split in two, and one section shifted up several centimeters. Engineers created a ramp from the lower section to the upper section. In the coordinate system shown in the figure below, the ramp is part of the graph of  ramp   By how much did the upper section of the street shift during the earthquake?  What is the horizontal distance from the bottom of the ramp to the raised part of the street?   cm  cm   The off-ramp from a highway connects to a parallel one-way road. The accompanying figure shows the highway, the off-ramp, and the road. The road lies on the -axis, and the off-ramp begins at a point on the -axis. The offramp is part of the graph of the polynomial  off-ramp   How far east of the exit does the off-ramp meet the one-way road?  How far apart are the highway and the road?    The number of minutes of daylight per day in Chicago is approximated by the polynomial where is the number of days since the summer solstice. The approximation is valid for . (A negative value of corresponds to a number of days before the summer solstice.)  Use a table of values with increments of days to estimate the range of the function on its domain.  Graph the polynomial on its domain.  How many minutes of daylight are there on the summer solstice?  How much daylight is there two weeks before the solstice?  When are the days more than hours long?  When are the days less than hours long?    quartic  min  min  Within days of the summer solstice  More than days from the summer solstice   The water level (in feet) at a harbor is approximated by the polynomial where is the number of hours since the high tide. The approximation is valid for . (A negative value of corresponds to a number of hours before the high tide.)  Use a table of values to estimate the range of the function on its domain.

  "body": " Graphing Polynomial Functions   In , we considered applications of polynomial functions. Although most applications use only a portion of the graph of a particular polynomial, we can learn a lot about these functions by taking a more global view of their behavior.   Classifying Polynomials by Degree  The graph of a polynomial function depends first of all on its degree. We have already studied the graphs of polynomials of degrees , , and .   A polynomial of degree is a constant, and its graph is a horizontal line. An example of such a polynomial function is .  A polynomial of degree is a linear function, and its graph is a straight line. The function is an example of a polynomial of degree .  horizontal line and line of nonzero slope    Quadratic functions, such as , are polynomials of degree . The graph of every quadratic function is a parabola, with the same basic shape as the standard parabola, . It has one turning point, where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. The turning point of a parabola is the same as its vertex.  basic parabola and parabola opening down    Cubic Polynomials  Do the graphs of all cubic cubic , or third-degree, polynomials have a basic shape in common? We can graph a few examples and find out. Unlike the basic parabola, the graph of is always increasing. At the origin, however, it changes from concave down to concave up. A point where the graph changes concavity is called an inflection point inflection point .  Graph the cubic polynomial and compare its graph with that of the basic cubic, .  The graph of the basic cubic is shown in figure (a) below. To help us understand the graph of the polynomial , we will evaluate the function to make a table of values. We can do this by hand or use the Table feature on the graphing calculator.  graphs of basic cubic and cubic with two turning points                      The graph of is shown in figure (b). It is not exactly the same shape as the basic cubic—it has two turning points—but it is similar, especially at the edges of the graphs.   QuickCheck 1   At an inflection point, a graph changes    direction.    concavity.    sign.    all of these.          A graph changes concavity at an inflection point.       Despite the differences in the central portions of the two graphs, they exhibit similar long-term behavior.  For very large and very small values of , both graphs look like the power function .  The -values increase from toward zero in the third quadrant, and they increase from zero toward in the first quadrant. Or we might say that the graphs start at the lower left and extend to the upper right.  All cubic polynomials display this behavior when their lead coefficients (the coefficient of the term) are positive.   Both of the graphs in are smooth curves without any breaks or holes. This smoothness is a feature of the graphs of all polynomial functions.  The domain of any polynomial function is the entire set of real numbers.   Practice 1     Complete the table of values below for                                                 Graph in the standard window.

All the essential features of the graphs are shown in these viewing windows. The graphs continue forever in the directions indicated, without any additional twists or turns.

In the Homework Problems, you will consider more graphs to help you verify the following observations.

A polynomial of even degree (with positive lead coefficient) has positive -values for both large positive and large negative .   graphs of a cubic and a quartic   Another way to describe the long-term behavior of a polynomial graph is to note that for large values of , the shape is similar to a power function of the same degree. It is the presence of the lower-degree terms in the polynomial that are responsible for any extra wiggles or turning points in the graph.  QuickCheck 2   The long-term behavior of a polynomial of degree    depends on the number of its zeros.    is the same as the behavior of .    may have a horizontal asymptote.    cannot be determined without a graph.          is the same as the behavior of        -Intercepts and the Factor Theorem  In , we saw that the x-intercepts of a quadratic polynomial, , occur at values of for which , that is, at the real-valued solutions of the equation . The same holds true for polynomials of higher degree.  Solutions of the equation are called zeros of the polynomial . In , we graphed the cubic polynomial . Its -intercepts are the solutions of the equation , which we can solve by factoring the polynomial . The zeros of are , , and . Each zero of corresponds to a factor of . This result suggests the following theorem, which holds for any polynomial .   Factor Theorem  Let be a polynomial with real number coefficients. Then is a factor of if and only if .   QuickCheck 3   Without graphing, how can you tell that the polynomial has no -intercepts?    A) It is quartic.    B) All of its coefficients are positive.    C) It cannot be factored further.    D) It has no turning points.          It cannot be factored further. Because the two quadratic factors are both positive for all their product is always positive.       The factor theorem follows from the division algorithm for polynomials. (See the Polynomials and Factoring section in Appendix Algebra Skills Refresher to review polynomial division.) We will consider both of these results in more detail in the Homework problems.  QuickCheck 4   The graph of which type of polynomial must have an -intercept?    Quadratic    Cubic    Quartic    None of these          The graph of any cubic polynomial must have at least one -intercept.       Because a polynomial function of degree can have at most linear factors of the form , it follows that can have at most distinct zeros.  Another way of saying this is that if is a polynomial of th degree, the equation can have at most distinct solutions, some of which may be complex numbers. (We consider complex numbers in .)  Because only real-valued solutions appear on the graph as -intercepts, we have the following corollary to the factor theorem.  -Intercepts of Polynomials  A polynomial of degree can have at most  -intercepts.  If some of the zeros of are complex numbers, they will not appear on the graph, so a polynomial of degree  may have fewer than  -intercepts.  Find the real-valued zeros of each of the following polynomials, and list the -intercepts of its graph.      Factor the polynomial to obtain By the factor theorem, the zeros of are , , and . (We say that has a zero of multiplicity two at .) Because all of these are real numbers, all will appear as -intercepts on the graph. Thus, the -intercepts occur at and at .  Factor the polynomial to obtain Because cannot be factored in real numbers, the graph has only two -intercepts, at and .

Zeros of Multiplicity Two or Three  The appearance of the graph near an -intercept is determined by the multiplicity of the zero there.  Both real zeros of the polynomial in b are of multiplicity one, and the graph crosses the -axis at each intercept.  The polynomial in a has a zero of multiplicity two at . The graph of just touches the -axis and then reverses direction without crossing the axis.  To understand what happens in general, compare the graphs of the three polynomials below.  plots of a linear, quadratic, and cubic, each with a single zero  In figure (a), has a zero of multiplicity one at , and its graph crosses the -axis there.  In figure (b), has a zero of multiplicity two at , and its graph touches the -axis there but changes direction without crossing.  In figure (c), has a zero of multiplicity three at . In this case, the graph makes an S-shaped curve at the intercept, like the graph of .   Near its -intercepts, the graph of a polynomial takes one of the characteristic shapes illustrated above.  Although we will not consider zeros of multiplicity greater than three, they correspond to similar behavior in the graph:  At a zero of odd multiplicity, the graph has an inflection point at the intercept; its graph makes an S-shaped curve.  At a zero of even multiplicity, the graph has a turning point; it changes direction without crossing the -axis.   Graph the polynomial  The polynomial has degree six, an even number, so its graph starts at the upper left and extends to the upper right.

For example, the graph of has no -intercepts (as shown at right), and the equation has no real solutions.  parabola without x-intercepts  We can still use completing the square or the quadratic formula to solve the equation.  Solve the equation by using the quadratic formula.  We substitute , , and into the quadratic formula to get Because is not a real number, the equation has no real solutions.   Practice 1   Solve the equation by using the quadratic formula.                Imaginary Numbers  Although square roots of negative numbers such as are not real numbers, they occur often in mathematics and its applications.  Mathematicians began working with square roots of negative numbers in the sixteenth century, in their attempts to solve quadratic and cubic equations. René Descartes gave them the name imaginary numbers, which reflected the mistrust with which mathematicians regarded them at the time. Today, however, such numbers are well understood and used routinely by scientists and engineers.  We begin by defining a new number, , whose square is .  Imaginary Unit i  We define the imaginary unit imaginary unit  by  The letter used in this way is not a variable; it is the name of a specific number and hence is a constant.  QuickCheck 1   What is the imaginary unit?                      is the imaginary unit, denoted by       The square root of any negative number can be written as the product of a real number and . For example, or . Any number that is the product of and a real number is called an imaginary number .  Imaginary Numbers imaginary number  For ,  Examples of imaginary numbers are  Write each radical as an imaginary number.         Practice 2   Write each radical as an imaginary number. Use for the imaginary unit, and enter sqrt(2) for                                  Every negative real number has two imaginary square roots, and , because and For example, the two square roots of are and .   Complex Numbers  Consider the quadratic equation Using the quadratic formula to solve the equation, we find If we now replace with , we have The two solutions are and . These numbers are examples of complex numbers complex number .  Complex Numbers  A complex number complex number can be written in the form , where and are real numbers.  Examples of complex numbers are In a complex number , is called the real part real part , and is called the imaginary part imaginary part . All real numbers are also complex numbers (with the imaginary part equal to zero). A complex number whose real part equals zero is called a pure imaginary pure imaginary number.  Write the solutions to , , as complex numbers.  Because , we have , or . The solutions are and .  Practice 3   Use extraction of roots to solve Write your answers as complex numbers.                Arithmetic of Complex Numbers  All the properties of real numbers listed in Algebra Skills Refresher are also true of complex numbers. We can carry out arithmetic operations with complex numbers.  QuickCheck 2   Which statement about complex numbers is false?    A) A complex number has a real part and an imaginary part.    B) We can perform all four arithmetic operations on complex numbers.    C) Every quadratic equation has solutions in the complex numbers.    D) Complex numbers cannot be combined with real numbers.          Complex numbers cannot be combined with real numbers is a false statement.       We add and subtract complex numbers by combining their real and imaginary parts separately. For example,  Sums and Differences of Complex Numbers    Subtract: .  Combine the real and imaginary parts.  Practice 4   Subtract:               Products of Complex Numbers  To find the product of two imaginary numbers, we use the fact that . For example, To find the product of two complex numbers, we use the FOIL method, as if the numbers were binomials. For example, Because , the last term, , can be replaced by , or , to obtain Finally, we combine the real parts and imaginary parts to obtain  Multiply .

This identity fails when and are both negative. For example, if , we have but so in this case We can avoid possible errors by writing square roots of negative numbers as imaginary numbers.  Pause and Reflect   How is multiplying complex numbers similar to multiplying binomials?        Quotients of Complex Numbers  To find the quotient of two complex numbers, we use the technique of rationalizing the denominator. (See Algebra Skills Refresher .)  For example, consider the quotient  Because is really a radical (remember that , we multiply the numerator and denominator of the quotient by to obtain To write the quotient in the form , we divide into each term of the numerator to get  Divide  We multiply numerator and denominator by . The quotient is .  Practice 6   Divide              If is any nonzero complex number, then the number is called the complex conjugate complex conjugate of . The product of a nonzero complex number and its conjugate is always a positive real number. We use this fact to find the quotient of complex numbers. If the divisor has both a real and an imaginary part, we multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.  QuickCheck 3   What is the product of with its complex conjugate?                            Divide  We multiply numerator and denominator by , the conjugate of the denominator.

Zeros of Polynomials  Because we can add, subtract, and multiply any two complex numbers, we can use a complex number as an input for a polynomial function. Thus, we can extend the domain of any polynomial to include all complex numbers.  Evaluate the polynomial for , then simplify.  We substitute to find Thus, , so is a solution of .  Practice 8   If evaluate              In , we learned that irrational solutions of quadratic equations occur in conjugate pairs, If the discriminant is negative, the two solutions are complex conjugates, Thus, if we know that is a complex solution of a quadratic equation, we know that is the other solution.

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra  Let be a polynomial of degree . Then has exactly complex zeros.   As a result, the factor theorem tells that every polynomial of degree can be factored as the product of linear terms. For example, although the graph of shown at right has no -intercepts, the fundamental theorem tells us that there are four complex solutions to , and that can be factored.  quartic with no x-intercepts  You can check that the four solutions to are , , , and . For example, if , then and so .  Because each zero corresponds to a factor of the polynomial, the factored form of is  The four solutions to form two complex conjugate pairs, namely and . In fact, for every polynomial with real coefficients, the nonreal zeros always occur in complex conjugate pairs.

Graphing Complex Numbers  Real numbers can be plotted on a number line, but to graph a complex number we use a plane, called the complex plane. In the complex plane complex plane , the real numbers lie on the horizontal or real axis real axis , and pure imaginary numbers lie on the vertical or imaginary axis imaginary axis .   plots of complex conjugates  To plot a complex number a + bi, we move units from the origin in the horizontal direction and units in the vertical direction.

Rational Function  A rational function rational function is one of the form where and are polynomials and is not the zero polynomial.   QuickCheck 1   Which of the following is not a rational function?                      is not a rational function because the numerator is not a polynomial.       The graphs of rational functions can be quite different from the graphs of polynomials.  Francine is planning a 60-mile training flight through the desert on her cycle-plane, a pedal-driven aircraft. If there is no wind, she can pedal at an average speed of 15 miles per hour, so she can complete the flight in 4 hours.  If there is a headwind of miles per hour, it will take Francine longer to fly 60 miles. Express the time it will take to complete the training flight as a function of .  Make a table of values for the function.  Graph the function and explain what it tells you about the time Francine should allot for the flight.    If there is a headwind of miles per hour, Francine's ground speed will be miles per hour. Using the fact that , we find that the time needed for the flight will be  We evaluate the function for several values of , as shown in the table below.                    For example, if the headwind is miles per hour, then Francine's effective speed is only miles per hour, and it will take her hours to fly the miles. The table shows that as the speed of the headwind increases, the time required for the flight increases also.  The graph of the function is shown below. You can use your calculator with the window to verify the graph. In particular, the point lies on the graph. This point tells us that if there is no wind, Francine can fly miles in hours, as we calculated earlier.  graph showing time to complete trip vs speed of headwind  The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at .  What about negative values for ? If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine's flying time should decrease for negative -values. For example, if , there is a tailwind of miles per hour, so Francine's effective speed is miles per hour, and she can complete the flight in hours. As the tailwind gets stronger (that is, as we move farther to the left in the -direction), Francine's flying time continues to decrease, and the graph approaches the -axis.   The vertical dashed line at on the graph of is a vertical asymptote vertical asymptote for the graph. We first encountered asymptotes in when we studied the graph of . Locating the vertical asymptotes of a rational function is an important part of determining the shape of the graph.  Practice 1   Queueing theory is used to predict your waiting time in a line, or queue. For example, suppose the attendant at a toll booth can process vehicles per minute. The average total time spent by a motorist negotiating the toll booth depends on the rate, at which vehicles arrive, according to the formula     What is the average time spent at the toll booth if vehicles arrive at a rate of vehicles per minute?  Answer: min.    Graph the function on the domain    What is the vertical asymptote of the graph?  Equation of asymptote:    What does the vertical asymptote tell you about the queue?    A) The wait time approaches 6 minutes as the arrival rate becomes infinite.    B) The wait time becomes infinite as the arrival rate approaches 6 vehicles per minute.    C) The wait time never reaches 6 minutes.                        min    A graph is below.       The wait time becomes infinite as the arrival rate approaches vehicles per minute.         Graph for part (b):  rational function   EarthCare decides to sell T-shirts to raise money. The company makes an initial investment of $100 to pay for the design of the T-shirt and to set up the printing process. After that, the T-shirts cost $5 each for labor and materials.  Express the average cost per T-shirt as a function of the number of T-shirts EarthCare produces.  Make a table of values for the function.  Graph the function and explain what it tells you about the cost of the T-shirts.    If EarthCare produces T-shirts, the total costs will be dollars. To find the average cost per T-shirt, we divide the total cost by the number of T-shirts produced, to get  We evaluate the function for several values of , as shown in the table                    If EarthCare makes only one T-shirt, its cost is $105. But if more than one T-shirt is made, the cost of the original $100 investment is distributed among them. For example, the average cost per T-shirt for T-shirts is and the average cost for T-shirts is  The graph is shown below. You can use your calculator with the window to verify the graph. Use the Trace to locate on the graph several points from the table of values. For example, the point indicates that if EarthCare makes T-shirts, the cost per shirt is $ .  graph of average cost of production  The graph shows that as the number of T-shirts increases, the average cost per shirt continues to decrease, but not as rapidly as at first. Eventually the average cost levels off and approaches $5 per T-shirt. For example, if EarthCare produces T-shirts, the average cost per shirt is   The horizontal line on the graph of is a horizontal asymptote horizontal asymptote . As increases, the graph approaches the line but never actually meets it. The average price per T-shirt will always be slightly more than $5. Horizontal asymptotes are also important in sketching the graphs of rational functions.  Practice 2   Delbert prepares a 20% glucose solution of by mixing 2 mL of glucose with 8 mL of water. If he adds ml of glucose to the solution, its concentration is given by     How many milliliters of glucose should Delbert add to increase the concentration to 50%?  Answer: ml    Graph the function on the domain    What is the horizontal asymptote of the graph?  Equation of asymptote: Use for the independent variable, and use for the dependent variable.    What does the horizontal asymptote tell you about the solution?    A) Delbert cannot add more than 100 mL glucose to the mixture.    B) If Delbert adds 1 mL of glucose to the mixture, its concentration becomes infinite.    C) As Delbert adds more glucose to the mixture, its concentration increases toward 100%.                        ml    A graph is below.       As Delbert adds more glucose to the mixture, its concentration increases toward         Graph for part (b):  rational function    Domain of a Rational Function  Most applications of rational functions have restricted domains, that is, they make sense for only a subset of the real numbers on the -axis. Consequently, only a portion of the graph is useful for analyzing the application. However, a knowledge of the general shape and properties of the whole graph can be very helpful in understanding a rational function.  As we stated earlier, a rational function is a quotient of two polynomials. Some examples of rational functions are shown below. Because we cannot divide by zero, a rational function is undefined for any value where . These -values are not in the domain of the function.  Find the domains of the rational functions , , , and defined above.   The domain of is the set of all real numbers except , because the denominator, , equals when .  The domain of is the set of all real numbers except , because equals zero when .  The denominator of the function , , is never equal to zero, so the domain of is all the real numbers.  The domain of is the set of all real numbers except and , because equals when or .  QuickCheck 2   The fraction    can be reduced to .    is undefined at and .    is equivalent to .    is equal to zero at and .          is equal to zero at and because the numerator (and not the denominator) is zero there.       We only need to exclude the zeros of the denominator from the domain of a rational function. We do not exclude the zeros of the numerator. In fact, the zeros of the numerator include the zeros of the rational function itself, because a fraction is equal to when its numerator is but its denominator is not .  Practice 3     Find the domain of  You may use the inequality symbols (    ) or enter your answers using interval notation. When using interval notation, use inf for and use U (an upper case letter u) for the union symbol    Find the zeros of  Separate different zeros with a comma.                 which is             Vertical Asymptotes  As we saw in , a polynomial function is defined for all values of , and its graph is a smooth curve without any breaks or holes. The graph of a rational function, on the other hand, will have breaks or holes at those -values where it is undefined.  Investigate the graph of near .  This function is undefined for , so there is no point on the graph with -coordinate . However, we can make a table of values for other values of . Plotting the ordered pairs in the table results in the points shown below.                  undefined            graph showing 6 points about a vertical asymptote  Next, we make a table showing -values close to , as shown below. As we choose -values closer and closer to , gets closer to , so the fraction gets very large. This means that the graph approaches, but never touches, the vertical line . In other words, the graph has a vertical asymptote at . We indicate the vertical asymptote by a dashed line, as shown in the figure.  table of values and graph of rational function   In general, we have the following result.   Vertical Asymptotes  If but , then the graph of the rational function has a vertical asymptote vertical asymptote at .   If and are both zero, then the graph of the rational function may have a hole at rather than an asymptote. (This possibility is considered in the homework exercises.)  Practice 4   Find the vertical asymptotes of  Equations of vertical asymptotes: Separate different equations with a comma.        and       QuickCheck 3   If the numerator and denominator of a rational function are both equal to zero at then    .    .    there is a vertical asymptote at .    there is a hole in the graph at .          there is a hole in the graph at       Near a vertical asymptote, the graph of a rational function has one of the four characteristic shapes, illustrated below. Locating the vertical asymptotes can help us make a quick sketch of a rational function.  4 cases of behavior near vertical asymptote  Locate the vertical asymptotes and sketch the graph of .  The denominator, , equals zero when . Because the numerator does not equal zero when , there is a vertical asymptote at . The asymptote separates the graph into two pieces.  We can use the Table feature of a calculator to evaluate for several values of on either side of the asymptote, as shown in figure (a). We plot the points found in this way; then connect the points on either side of the asymptote to obtain the graph shown in figure (b).  table and graph of rational funciton  Practice 5     Find the vertical asymptotes of .

As gets large—that is, as we move away from the origin along the -axis in either direction—the corresponding -values get closer and closer to . The graph approaches, but never coincides with, the line . We say that the graph has a horizontal asymptote horizontal asymptote at .  When does a rational function have a horizontal asymptote? It depends on the degrees of the two polynomials and . The degree of the numerator of is equal to the degree of the denominator. In other words, the highest power of in the numerator (1, in this case) is the same as the highest power in the denominator.  Consider the three rational functions whose graphs are shown below.  3 cases of end behavior   The graph of in figure (a) has a horizontal asymptote at , the -axis, because the degree of the denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator. Higher powers of grow much more rapidly than smaller powers. Thus, for large values of , the denominator is much larger in absolute value than the numerator of , so the function values approach .  The graph of in figure (b) has a horizontal asymptote at , because the numerator and denominator of the fraction have the same degree. For large values of , the terms of lower degree are negligible compared to the squared terms. As increases, is approximately equal to , or . Thus, the function values approach a constant value of .  The graph of in figure (c) does not have a horizontal asymptote, because the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. As increases, grows much faster than , so their ratio does not approach a constant value. The function values increase without bound.   We summarize our discussion as follows.   Horizontal Asymptotes  Suppose is a rational function, where the degree of is and the degree of is .  If , the graph of has a horizontal asymptote at .  If , the graph of has a horizontal asymptote at , where is the lead coefficient of and is the lead coefficient of .  If , the graph of does not have a horizontal asymptote.

Locate the horizontal asymptotes and sketch the graph of .  The numerator and denominator of the fraction are both second-degree polynomials, so the graph does have a horizontal asymptote. The lead coefficients of and are and , respectively, so the horizontal asymptote is , or .  The function does not have a vertical asymptote because the denominator, , is never equal to zero.  The -intercept of the graph is the point . We can plot several points by evaluating the function at convenient -values, and use the asymptote to help us sketch the graph, as shown below.  rational function with horizontal asymptote at y=2  Practice 6   Locate the horizontal and vertical asymptotes and sketch the graph of Label the - and -intercepts with their coordinates.

(See Appendix A.9 Working with Algebraic Fractions to review reducing algebraic fractions.)        Applications  It is often useful to simplify the formula for a rational function before using it. (See Algebra Skills Refresher to review operations on algebraic fractions.)  When estimating their travel time, pilots must take into account the prevailing winds. A tailwind adds to the plane's ground speed, while a headwind decreases the ground speed. Skyhigh Airlines is setting up a shuttle service from Dallas to Phoenix, a distance of miles.  Express the time needed for a one-way trip, without wind, as a function of the speed of the plane.  Suppose there is a prevailing wind of miles per hour blowing from the west. Write expressions for the flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Dallas.  Write an expression for the round-trip flying time, excluding stops, with a -mile-per-hour wind from the west, as a function of the plane's speed. Simplify your expression.    Recall that . If we let represent the speed of the plane in still air, then the time required for a one-way trip is  On the trip from Dallas to Phoenix, the plane encounters a headwind of miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is . On the return trip, the plane enjoys a tailwind of miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is . Therefore, the flying times are and  The round-trip flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and back is The LCD for these fractions is . Thus,   (See Algebra Skills Refresher to review adding fractions.)

  "body": " Equations That Include Algebraic Fractions   When working with rational functions, we often need to solve equations that involve algebraic fractions.  In of , we wrote a function that gave the time Francine needs for a 60-mile training run on her cycle-plane in terms of the windspeed, : If it takes Francine hours to cover miles, what is the speed of the wind? We can answer this question by reading values from the graph of , as shown at right. When , the value of is between and , so the windspeed is between and miles per hour.  graph of rational function for solving equation    Solving Equations with Fractions Algebraically  If we need a more accurate value for the windspeed, we can solve the equation To solve an equation involving an algebraic fraction, we multiply each side of the equation by the denominator of the fraction. This has the effect of clearing the fraction, giving us an equivalent equation without fractions.  Solve the equation  We multiply both sides of the equation by to obtain From here we can proceed as usual. The windspeed was , or miles per hour.  Practice 1   Solve               If the equation contains more than one fraction, we can clear all the denominators at once by multiplying both sides by the LCD of the fractions.  Rani times herself as she kayaks 30 miles down the Derwent River with the help of the current. Returning upstream against the current, she manages only 18 miles in the same amount of time. Rani knows that she can kayak at a rate of 12 miles per hour in still water. What is the speed of the current?  If we let represent the speed of the current, we can use the formula to fill in the following table.     Distance  Rate  Time   Downstream      Upstream      Because Rani paddled for equal amounts of time upstream and downstream, we have the equation The LCD for the fractions in this equation is . We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to obtain Solving this equation, we find The speed of the current is miles per hour.  Practice 2   Solve               Pause and Reflect   If the variable in an equation appears in the denominator of a fraction, what should you do to solve the equation?       Solving Equations with Fractions Graphically  We can solve the equation in graphically by considering two functions, one for each side of the equation. Graph the two functions in the window to obtain the graph shown below.   The function gives the time it takes Rani to paddle 30 miles downstream, and gives the time it takes her to paddle miles upstream. Both of these times depend on the speed of the current, .  We are looking for a value of that makes and equal. This occurs at the intersection point of the two graphs, . Thus, the speed of the current is miles per hour, as we found in . The -coordinate of the intersection point gives the time Rani paddled on each part of her trip: hours each way.    Extraneous Solutions  A rational function is undefined for any values of that make its denominator equal zero. These values are not in the domain of the function, and they therefore cannot be solutions to equations involving the function. Consider the equation When we multiply both sides by the LCD, , we obtain or whose solution is However, is not a solution of the original equation. Both sides of the equation are undefined at . If you graph the two functions you will find that the graphs never intersect, which means that there is no solution to the original equation.  What went wrong with our method of solution? We multiplied both sides of the equation by , which is zero when , so we really multiplied both sides of the equation by zero. Multiplying by zero does not produce an equivalent equation, and false solutions may be introduced.  An apparent solution that does not satisfy the original equation is called an extraneous solution extraneous solution . Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solution obtained is not excluded from the domain of the rational functions involved.  When solving an equation with fractions algebraically, we must be careful to multiply each term of the equation by the LCD, no matter whether each term involves fractions.   Solve the equation algebraically.  Solve the same equation graphically.    To solve the equation algebraically, we multiply both sides by the LCD, . Notice that we multiply each term on the left side by the LCD, to get or We use the distributive law to remove the parentheses and write the result in standard form: This is a quadratic equation that we can solve by factoring. so the solutions are and . Neither of these values causes either denominator to equal zero, so they are not extraneous solutions.  To solve the equation graphically, graph the two functions in the window as shown in figure (a).  GC images of intersecting rational functions  We see that the first graph has an asymptote at , and the second graph has one at . It appears that the two graphs may intersect in the third quadrant, around . To investigate further, we change the window settings to to obtain the close-up view shown in figure (b). In this window, we can see that the graphs intersect in two distinct points, and by using the Trace we find that their -coordinates are and .   QuickCheck 1   Which of these is the correct first step to solve ?                      If we multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD we obtain       Practice 3   Solve               Pause and Reflect   What are extraneous solutions, and when might they occur?        Formulas  Algebraic fractions may appear in formulas that relate several variables. If we want to solve for one variable in terms of the others, we may need to clear the fractions.  Solve the formula for .  Because the variable we want appears in the denominator, we must first multiply both sides of the equation by that denominator, . We apply the distributive law on the left side, then collect all terms that involve on one side of the equation. We cannot combine the two terms containing because they are not like terms. However, we can factor out , so that the right side is written as a single term containing the variable . We can then complete the solution.

Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.  Extraneous solution     CONCEPTS    To solve an equation involving an algebraic fraction, we multiply each side of the equation by the denominator of the fraction. This has the effect of clearing the fraction, giving us an equivalent equation without fractions.  Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solutions obtained are not extraneous.    STUDY QUESTIONS   What is the first step in solving an equation that includes algebraic fractions?  If the equation also contains terms without fractions, should you multiply those terms by the LCD?

Cube of a Binomial              Factoring the Sum or Difference of Two Cubes             The graphs of all polynomials are smooth curves without breaks or holes.  The graph of a polynomial of degree (with positive lead coefficient) has the same long-term behavior as the power function of the same degree.   Factor Theorem  Let be a polynomial with real number coefficients. Then is a factor of if and only if .   A polynomial of degree can have at most  -intercepts.  At a zero of multiplicity , the graph of a polynomial has a turning point. At a zero of multiplicity , the graph of a polynomial has an inflection point.  The square root of a negative number is an imaginary number.  A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number.  We can perform the four arithmetic operations on complex numbers  The product of a nonzero complex number and its conjugate is always a positive real number.   Fundamental Theorem of Algebra  Let be a polynomial of degree . Then has exactly complex zeros.   We can graph complex numbers in the complex plane  Multiplying a complex number by rotates its graph by around the origin.   Rational Function  A rational function rational function is one of the form where and are polynomials and is not the zero polynomial.   A rational function is undefined for any value where .

If , the graph of has a horizontal asymptote at , where is the lead coefficient of and is the lead coefficient of .  If , the graph of does not have a horizontal asymptote.     To solve an equation involving an algebraic fraction, we multiply each side of the equation by the denominator of the fraction. This has the effect of clearing the fraction, giving us an equivalent equation without fractions.  Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solutions obtained are not extraneous.  .

This special form was first solved by the Italian mathematicians Scipione del Ferro and Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia early in the sixteenth century. Tartaglia revealed the secret to solving the special cubic equation in a poem. He first found values and to satisfy the system   We will use Tartaglia's method to solve What are the values of and ?  Substitute the values of and into Tartaglia's system, then use substitution to solve for and . You should find two possible solutions.  For each solution of the system, compute . You should get the same value of for each .  Check that your value for is a solution of .    Solving cubics: Part II Tartaglia's method always works to solve the special cubic equation, even when and are not convenient values. We will show why in this project.  Expand the expression and complete the identity.   Your answer to part (a) is actually Tartaglia's special cubic in disguise. Substitute , , and to see this. Therefore, if we can find numbers and that satisfy then the solution to Tartaglia's cubic is .  Compare the system in part (b) to the system from , to show that and .  Use your answer to part (c) to show that Tartaglia's value, , is a solution of .    Solving cubics: Part III Use Tartaglia's method to solve the equation by carrying out the following steps.  Identify the values of and from and write two equations for and .  Solve for values of and . You will need to use the quadratic formula.  Take the positive values of and . Write the solution . Do not try to simply the radical expression; instead, use your calculator to check the solution numerically.    Solving cubics: Part IV We can solve any cubic equation by first using a substitution to put the equation in Tartaglia's special form.  Consider the equation . Make the substitution , and expand the left side of the equation.  What is the coefficient of in the resulting equation? What are the values of and ?  If you solve the special form in part (a) for , how can you find the value of that solves the original equation?    Duration of eclipse The time, , it takes for the Moon to eclipse the Sun totally is given (in minutes) by the formula where is the diameter of the Moon, is the diameter of the Sun, is the distance from the Earth to the Moon, is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, and is the speed of the Moon.  Solve the formula for in terms of the other variables.  It takes minutes for the Moon to eclipse the Sun. Calculate the speed of the Moon given the following values:     Optimal traffic flow The stopping distance, , for a car traveling at speed meters per second is given (in meters) by where is the reaction time of the driver and is the average deceleration as the car brakes. Suppose that all the cars on a crowded motorway maintain the appropriate spacing determined by the stopping distance for their speed. What speed allows the maximum flow of cars along the road per unit time? Using the formula , we see that the time interval, , between cars is where is the length of the car. To achieve the maximum flow of cars, we would like to be as small as possible. (Source: Bolton, 1974)  Substitute the expression for into the formula for , then simplify.  A typical reaction time is seconds, a typical car length is meters, and meters per second squared. With these values, graph as a function of in the window   To one decimal place, what value of gives the minimum value of ? Convert your answer to miles per hour.    Effective population of endangered species Many endangered species have fewer than individuals left. To preserve the species, captive breeding programs must maintain a certain effective population, , given by where is the number of breeding females and the number of breeding males. (Source: Chapman and Reiss, 1992)  What is the effective population if there are equal numbers of breeding males and females?  In 1972, a breeding program for Speke's gazelle was established with just three female gazelle. Graph the effective population, , as a function of the number of males.  What is the largest effective population that can be created with three females? How many males are needed to achieve the maximum value?  With three females, for what value of is ?  The breeding program for Speke's gazelle began with only one male. What was the effective population?    Biological half-life When a drug or chemical is injected into a patient, biological processes begin removing that substance. If no more of the substance in introduced, the body removes a fixed fraction of the substance each hour. The amount of substance remaining in the body at time is an exponential decay function, so there is a biological half-life biological half-life to the substance denoted by . If the substance is a radioisotope, it undergoes radioactive decay and so has a physical half-life as well, denoted .  The effective half-life effective half-life , denoted by , is related to the biological and physical half-lives by the equation The radioisotope is used as a label for the human serum albumin. The physical half-life of is days. (Source: Pope, 1989)  If is cleared from the body with a half-life of days, what is the effective half-life of ?  The biological half-life of a substance varies considerably from person to person. If the biological half-life of is days, what is the effective half life?  Let represent the effective half-life of when the biological half-life is days. Graph .  What would the biological half-life of need to be to produce an effective half-life of days? Label the corresponding point on your graph.  For what possible biological half-lives of will the effective half-life be less than days?    Rate of eating Animals spend most of their time hunting or foraging for food to keep themselves alive. Knowing the rate at which an animal (or population of animals) eats can help us determine its metabolic rate or its impact on its habitat. The rate of eating is proportional to the availability of food in the area, but it has an upper limit imposed by mechanical considerations, such as how long it takes the animal to capture and ingest its prey. (Source: Burton, 1998)  Sketch a graph of eating rate as a function of quantity of available food. This will be a qualitative graph only; you do not have enough information to put scales on the axes.  Suppose that the rate at which an animal catches its prey is proportional to the number of prey available, or , where is a constant and is the number of available prey. The rate at which it handles and eats the prey is constant, . Write expressions for and , the times for catching and handling prey.  Show that the rate of food consumption is given by  Hint : , where is the number of prey consumed in the interval , where .  In a study of ladybirds, it was discovered that larvae in their second stage of development consumed aphids at a rate aphids per day, given by where is the number of aphids available. Larvae in the third stage ate at rate , given by Graph both of these functions on the domain .  What is the maximum rate at which ladybird larvae in each stage of development can consume aphids?    Buoyancy A person will float in fresh water if his or her density is less than or equal to kilogram per liter, the density of water. (Density is given by the formula .) Suppose a swimmer weighs kilograms, where is the amount of fat her body contains. (Source: Burton, 1998)  Calculate the volume of her nonfat body mass if its density is kilograms per liter.  Calculate the volume of the fat if its density is kilograms per liter.  The swimmer’s lungs hold liters of air. Write an expression for the total volume of her body, including the air in her lungs.  Write an expression for the density of the swimmer's body.  Write an equation for the amount of fat needed for the swimmer to float in fresh water.  Solve your equation. What percent of the swimmer's weight is fat?  Suppose the swimmer's lungs can hold liters of air. What percent body fat does she need to be buoyant?    "

(Source: Burton, 1998)  Sketch a graph of eating rate as a function of quantity of available food. This will be a qualitative graph only; you do not have enough information to put scales on the axes.  Suppose that the rate at which an animal catches its prey is proportional to the number of prey available, or , where is a constant and is the number of available prey. The rate at which it handles and eats the prey is constant, . Write expressions for and , the times for catching and handling prey.

  "body": " Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables   Systems of linear equations are some of the most useful and widely used mathematical tools for solving problems. Systems involving hundreds of variables and equations are not uncommon in applications such as scheduling airline flights or routing telephone calls.  We begin our study by reviewing linear systems.   Solving Systems by Graphing  A biologist wants to know the average weights of two species of birds in a wildlife preserve. She sets up a feeder whose platform is actually a scale and mounts a camera to monitor the feeder. She waits until the feeder is occupied only by members of the two species she is studying, doves and blue jays. Then she takes a picture, which records the number of each species on the scale and the total weight registered.  From her two best pictures, she obtains the following information. The total weight of three blue jays and six doves is ounces, and the total weight of five blue jays and two doves is ounces. Using these data, the biologist estimates the average weight of a blue jay and of a dove. She begins by assigning variables to the two unknown quantities:  Because there are two variables, the biologist must write two equations about the weights of the birds. In each of the two photos,   Thus, This pair of equations is an example of a linear system linear system  of two equations in two unknowns (or a linear system, for short). A solution solution to the system is an ordered pair of numbers, , that satisfies both equations in the system.  graph of two linear equations  Recall that every point on the graph of an equation represents a solution to that equation. A solution to both equations corresponds to a point on both graphs. Therefore, a solution to the system is a point where the two graphs intersect.  From the figure above, it appears that the intersection point is , so we expect that the values and form the solution to the system. We can check by verifying that these values satisfy both equations in the system. Both equations are true, so we conclude that the average weight of a blue jay is ounces, and the average weight of a robin is ounces.  QuickCheck 1   Which points on the graphs satisfy both equations in a system?    Their -intercepts    Their -intercepts    Their intersection points    None of the points          Their intersection points       We can obtain graphs for the equations in a system quickly and easily using a calculator.  Use your calculator to solve the system by graphing.   We set the graphing window to and enter the two equations. We can see in the figure that the two lines intersect in the third quadrant. We use the TRACE key to find the coordinates of the intersection point, . The solution to the system is , .  GC display of 2 lines intersecting in 3rd quadrant  The values we obtain from a calculator may be only approximations, so it is a good idea to check the solution algebraically. In , we find that both equations are true when we substitute and .   QuickCheck 2   How can you verify that a given point is the solution of a system?    A) Add the equations together.    B) Show that it makes one of the equations true.    C) Show that it makes both equations true.    D) Subtract the equations.          We show that a point makes both equations true to verify that it is the solution of a system of two equations.       Practice 1     Solve the system of equations   by graphing. Use the window     Answer:        is the intersection point.       Pause and Reflect   What do the points on the graph of an equation represent?       Using the Intersect Feature to Solve a System  Graphing utilities have an intersect feature to find the coordinates of the intersection of two graphs. In the next Example we demonstrate the intersect feature of the calculator. (There is also an Example in Appendix C Using a Geogebra Calculator app that shows the intersect feature in Geogebra.)   Solve the system   We can graph this system in the standard window by solving each equation for . We enter and then press ZOOM  . (Don't forget the parentheses around the numerator of each expression.)  We Trace along the first line to find the intersection point. It appears to be at , , as shown in figure (a). However, if we press the up or down arrow to read the coordinates off the second line, we see that for the same -coordinate we obtain a different -coordinate, as in figure (b).  The different -coordinates indicate that we have not found an intersection point, although we are close. The intersect feature can give us a better estimate, , .  GC display of 2 lines intersecting in 4th quadrant  We can substitute these values into the original system to check that they satisfy both equations.   Practice 2   Solve the system of equations   by graphing. Use the intersect feature in the window   Answer:        is the intersection point.        Solving Systems Algebraically  In previous algebra courses, you learned two algebraic techniques for solving linear systems: substitution and elimination . See Algebra Skills Refresher if you would like to review these techniques.  Rani kayaks downstream for minutes and travels a distance of meters. On the return journey upstream, she covers only meters in minutes. How fast is the current in the river, and how fast would Rani kayak in still water? (Give your answers in meters per minute.)   First, we choose variables for the two unknown quantities.  Rani's speed in still water:   Speed of the current:    We must write two equations using the variables and .  First, we organize the information into a table. When Rani travels downstream, the current in the river helps her, so her effective speed is . When she travels upstream she is fighting the current, so her speed is actually .    Rate  Time  Distance  Downstream     Upstream      Using the formula , we write one equation describing Rani's journey downstream, and a second equation for the journey upstream. We apply the distributive law to write each equation in standard form.   To solve the system, we eliminate the variable by adding the two equations vertically.                   We now have an equation in one variable only, which we can solve for .  To solve for we substitute into any previous equation involving both and . We will use Equation (1).   The speed of the current is , or meters per minute, and Rani's speed in still water is meters per minute.   Practice 3   It took Leon hours to fly the same distance that Marlene drove in hours. Leon flies miles per hour faster than Marlene drives. At what speed did each travel?    Let be Leon s speed (mph), let be Marlene s speed (mph), and fill in the table.         Rate  Time  Distance    Leon       Marlene         Write one equation about the Leon s and Marlene s speeds.  Equation:    Write a second equation about distances.  Equation:    Solve the system and answer the question in the problem.  Enter your solution as an ordered pair.  Leon traveled at a speed of mph, and Marlene traveled at a speed of mph.                                                                     Rate  Time  Distance    Leon       Marlene         or       Leon flies at mph; Marlene drives at mph.         Pause and Reflect   When is the substitution method easier to use than the elimination method. Why?        Inconsistent and Dependent Systems  Because two straight lines do not always intersect at a single point, a system of linear equations does not always have a unique solution. In fact, there are three possibilities, as illustrated below.  3 cases for 3x3 linear system, namely two coincident lines, two parallel lines, or two lines intersecting in a single point  The graphs may be the same line, as shown in figure (a).  The graphs may be parallel but distinct lines, as shown in figure (b).  The graphs may intersect in one and only one point, as shown in figure (c).   Solve the system   We use the calculator to graph both equations on the same axes, as shown below. First, we rewrite the second equation in slope-intercept form by solving for .  Next, we enter the equations as  GC parallel lines   The lines do not intersect within the viewing window; they appear to be parallel. If we look again at the equations of the lines, we recognize that both have slope but different -intercepts, so they are parallel. Because parallel lines never meet, there is no solution to the system.  A system with no solutions, such as the system in , is called inconsistent inconsistent . A system of linear equations is inconsistent when the two equations correspond to parallel lines. This situation occurs when the lines have the same slope but different -intercepts.  Practice 4   Without graphing, show that the following system is inconsistent:     Both lines have slope .    Both lines have slope 2.    The two equations must be graphed to determine if the system is inconsistent.          Both lines have slope       A linear system with infinitely many solutions is called dependent dependent . A system is dependent when the two equations actually describe the same line. This situation occurs when the two lines have the same slope and the same -intercept.  Solve the system   We begin by putting each equation in slope-intercept form. For the second equation,  The two equations are actually different forms of the same equation. Because they are equivalent, they share the same line as a graph, as shown at right. Every point on the first line is also a point on the second line, so every solution to the first equation is also a solution of the second equation. Thus, the system has infinitely many solutions.  one line with two equations   Here is a summary of the three cases for a system of linear equations.  Solutions of Linear Systems   Dependent system dependent system . All the solutions of one equation are also solutions to the second equation and hence are solutions of the system. The graphs of the two equations are the same line. A dependent system has infinitely many solutions.  Inconsistent system inconsistent system . The graphs of the equations are parallel lines and hence do not intersect. An inconsistent system has no solutions.  Consistent and independent system consistent and independent system . The graphs of the two lines intersect in exactly one point. The system has exactly one solution.   Practice 5     Graph the system   by hand, using either the intercept method or the slope-intercept method.    Identify the system as dependent, inconsistent, or consistent and independent.    dependent    inconsistent    consistent and independent              A graph is below.    Inconsistent: The graph consists of parallel lines.         Graph for part (a)  parallel lines   It is not always easy to tell from the equations themselves whether there is one solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions. However, the method of elimination will reveal which of the three cases applies.  Solve the system    First, we rewrite the system in standard form as We multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (2) to obtain                   This equation has no solutions. The system is inconsistent. (Notice that both lines have slope , but they have different -intercepts, so their graphs are parallel.)  We generalize the results from as follows.   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems    If an equation of the form is obtained as a linear combination of the equations in a system, the system is inconsistent inconsistent .  If an equation of the form is obtained as a linear combination of the equations in a system, the system is dependent dependent .     QuickCheck 3   If a system is inconsistent, the two lines:    are parallel.    are perpendicular.    intersect.    have the same graph.          If a system is inconsistent, the two lines are parallel.       The following illustrates a dependent system.  Practice 6     Use the method of elimination to solve the system   Elimination results in .    Verify that both equations have the same graph.    Both equations have slope-intercept form .    Both equations have slope-intercept form .    The two equations must be graphed to determine if the system is inconsistent.                             Elimination results in    Both equations have slope-intercept form         Pause and Reflect   Explain how to use linear combinations to identify inconsistent and dependent systems.        Applications  Many practical problems involve two or more unknown quantities.  A cup of rolled oats provides 11 grams of protein. A cup of rolled wheat flakes provides 8.5 grams of protein. Francine wants to combine oats and wheat to make a cereal with 10 grams of protein per cup. How much of each grain will she need in one cup of her mixture?     Fraction of a cup of oats needed:   Fraction of a cup of wheat needed:    Because we have two variables, we must find two equations that describe the problem. It may be helpful to organize the information into a table.    Cups  Grams of protein per cup  Grams of protein  Oats     Wheat     Mixture      The wheat and oats together will make one cup of mixture, so the first equation is The grams of protein must come form the protein in the oats plus the protein in the wheat. This gives us a second equation: We now have a system of equations.  We will solve the system by graphing. First, solve each equation for in terms of to get Although we could simplify the second equation, the calculator can graph both equations as they are. We know that and represent fractions of one cup, so we set the window (as shown below) with  GC graph of 2x2 system The lines intersect at , which we can verify by substituting these values into the original two equations of our system.  Francine needs cup of oats and cup of wheat.   Practice 7   Etienne plans to open a coffee house, and he has $ to spend on furniture. A table costs $ and a chair costs $ Etienne will buy four chairs for each table. How many tables can he buy?    Let represent the number of tables Etienne should buy, and let represent the number of chairs. Write an equation about the cost of the furniture.    Write a second equation about the number of tables and chairs.    Graph both equations, solve the system, and answer the question in the problem. (Find the intercepts of the graphs to help you choose a window.)  ,    A) Etienne should buy 16 tables and 4 chairs.    B) Etienne should buy 32 tables and 8 chairs.    C) Etienne should buy 8 tables and 32 chairs.    D) Etienne should buy 4 tables and 16 chairs.                                        Etienne should buy 8 tables and 32 chairs.         Being unable to read exact coordinates from a graph is not always a disadvantage. In many situations, fractional values of the unknowns are not acceptable.  The mathematics department has $ to set up a new computer lab. The department will need one printer for every four terminals it purchases. If a printer costs $ and a terminal costs $ , how many of each should the department buy?     Number of printers:   Number of terminals    Since the math department needs four times as many terminals as printers, The total cost of the printers will be dollars, and the total cost of the terminals will be dollars, so we have  We solve the second equation for to get Now we graph the equations on the same set of axes. The second graph is not visible in the standard graphing window, but with a little experimentation we can find an appropriate window setting. The WINDOW values used for the figure below are  GC graph of supply and demand of wool fabric  The lines intersect at approximately . These values satisfy the first equation, but not the second.   The exact solution to the system is . But this solution is not of practical use, since the math department cannot purchase fractions of printers or terminals. The department can purchase printers and terminals (with some money left over).   Practice 8   The manager for Books for Cooks plans to spend $300 stocking a new diet cookbook. The paperback version costs her $5, and the hardback costs $10. She finds that she will sell three times as many paperbacks as hardbacks. How many of each should she buy?    Let represent the number of hardbacks and the number of paperbacks she should buy. Write an equation about the cost of the books.    Write a second equation about the number of each type of book.    Graph both equations and solve the system. (Find the intercepts of the graphs to help you choose a window.) Answer the question in the problem.  ,    A) The manager should buy 12 hardbacks and 36 paperbacks.    B) The manager should buy 36 hardbacks and 12 paperbacks.    C) The manager should buy 27 hardbacks and 9 paperbacks.    D) The manager should buy 9 hardbacks and 27 paperbacks.                                        The manager should buy hardbacks and paperbacks.          An Application from Economics  The owner of a retail business must try to balance the demand for his product from consumers with the supply he can obtain from manufacturers. Supply and demand both vary with the price of the product: Consumers usually buy fewer items if the price increases, but manufacturers will be willing to supply more units of the product if its price increases.  The demand function demand function gives the number of units of the product that consumers will buy in terms of the price per unit. The supply function supply function gives the number of units that the producer will supply in terms of the price per unit. The price at which the supply and demand are equal is called the equilibrium price equilibrium price . This is the price at which the consumer and the producer agree to do business.  A woolens mill can produce yards of fine suit fabric if it can charge dollars per yard. The mill's clients in the garment industry will buy yards of wool fabric at a price of dollars per yard. Find the equilibrium price and the amount of fabric that will change hands at that price.     Price per yard:   Number of yards:    The supply equation tells us how many yards of fabric the mill will produce for a price of dollars per yard. The demand equation tells us how many yards of fabric the garment industry will buy at a price of dollars per yard.   We graph the two equations on the same set of axes, as shown below. We set the window values to and use the TRACE or the intersect command to locate the solution. The graphs intersect at the point .

  "body": " Systems of Linear Equations in Three Variables   Some problems involve three (or more) unknown quantities, and efficient techniques for solving linear systems in many variables are available. In this section, we solve systems of three linear equations in three variables.  Linear Systems  A solution to an equation in three variables, such as is an ordered triple of numbers that satisfies the equation. For example, and are solutions to the equation above, but is not. You can verify this by substituting the coordinates into the equation to see if a true statement results. As with the two-variable case, a single linear equation in three variables has infinitely many solutions.  An ordered triple can be represented geometrically as a point in space using a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, as shown below. In this coordinate system, the graph of a linear equation in three variables is a plane, and the fact that there are infinitely many solutions to the equation tells us that that there are infinitely many points in the corresponding plane.  point in 3D space  A solution to a system of three linear equations in three variables is an ordered triple that satisfies each equation in the system. That triple represents a point that must lie on all three graphs. The figure below shows the different ways in which three planes may intersect in space.  8 cases of how 3 planes can intersect   In figure (a), the three planes intersect in a single point, so the corresponding system of three equations has a unique solution.  In figures (b), (c), and (d), the intersection is either a line or an entire plane, so the corresponding system has infinitely many solutions. Such a system is called dependent dependent .  In figures (e), (f), (g), and (h), the three planes have no common intersection, so the corresponding system has no solution. In this case, the system is said to be inconsistent inconsistent .   It is impractical to solve systems by graphing. Even when technology for producing three-dimensional graphs is available, we cannot read coordinates on such graphs with any confidence. Thus, we will restrict our attention to algebraic methods of solving such systems.  Pause and Reflect   What is a solution to a 3x3 linear system?        Back-Substitution  When we review our algebraic methods for systems—substitution and linear combinations—we find features common to both. In both methods, we obtain an equation in one variable. Once we have solved for that variable, we substitute the value into an earlier equation to find the other variable.  One strategy for solving a system extends this idea to include a third variable and a third equation. The following special case illustrates the substitution part of the procedure.  Solve the system  The third equation involves only the variable , so we solve that equation to find . Then we substitute for in the second equation and solve for . Finally, we substitute for and for into the first equation to find . The solution is the ordered triple . You should verify that this triple satisfies all three equations of the system.  The technique used in is called back-substitution back-substitution . It works in the special case where one of the equations involves exactly one variable, and a second equation involves that same variable and just one other variable. A linear system with these properties is said to be in triangular form triangular form . If we can transform a system into triangular form, we can use back-substitution to complete the solution.  Practice 1   Use back-substitution to solve the system   Solution:              QuickCheck 1   What sort of system can be solved by back-substitution?    Any linear system    A triangular system    A dependent system    A complex system          A triangular system        Gaussian Reduction  We can use linear combinations to reduce a system to triangular form and then use back-substitution to find the solutions. Our strategy will be to eliminate one of the variables from each of the three equations by considering them in pairs. This results in a system that we can solve using elimination. As an example, consider the system   This system is already in standard form. We can choose any one of the three variables to eliminate first. For this example, we will eliminate .  Choose two of the equations, say (1) and (2), and use a linear combination: We multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (2) to produce Equation (4).                                  Now we have an equation involving only two variables. But we need two equations in two unknowns to find the solution. So we choose a different pair of equations, say (1) and (3), and eliminate again. We multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (3) to obtain Equation (5).                                  We now form a system with our new Equations (4) and (5). We eliminate either or to obtain an equation in a single variable. If we choose to eliminate , we add times Equation (4) to times Equation (5) to obtain Equation (6).                            Now we can start solving for the variables. To keep things organized, we form a triangular system: Choose one of the original equations (in three variables), one of the equations from our system, and our final equation in one variable. We choose Equations (1), (4), and (6).  This new system is in triangular form, and it has the same solutions as the original system. We complete the solution by back-substitution. Solve Equation (6) to find . Substituting for in Equation (4), we find  Finally, we substitute for and for into Equation (1) to find The solution to the system is the ordered triple . You can verify that this triple satisfies all three of the original equations.   QuickCheck 2   After we eliminate one variable from a pair of equations, what is the next step?    A) Eliminate a different variable from the same pair of equations.    B) Eliminate the same variable from a different pair of equations.    C) Eliminate a different variable from a different pair of equations.    D) Substitute into the third equation.          Eliminate the same variable from a different pair of equations.       The method described above for putting a linear system into triangular form is called Gaussian reduction Gaussian reduction , after the German mathematician Carl Gauss. We summarize our method for solving a linear system as follows.   Steps for Solving a Linear System    Clear each equation of fractions and put it in standard form.  Choose two of the equations and eliminate one of the variables by forming a linear combination.  Choose a different pair of equations and eliminate the same variable.  Form a system with the equations found in steps (2) and (3). Eliminate one of the variables from this system by using a linear combination.  Form a triangular system by choosing among the previous equations. Use back-substitution to solve the triangular system.     Solve the system  Follow the steps outlined above.  We multiply each side of Equation (2) by , and each side of Equation (3) by , to obtain the equivalent system  We eliminate from Equations (1) and (2a) by adding them together.                                  We eliminate from Equations (1) and (3a): We multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (3a).                                  We form the system consisting of Equations (4) and (5).  We form a triangular system using Equations (1), (4), and (6). We use back-substitution to find the solution. You can verify that the ordered triple satisfies all three of the original equations of the system.   Practice 2   Use Gaussian reduction to solve the system   Follow the steps suggested below:    Clear the fractions from Equation (2).    Eliminate from Equations (1) and (2).    Eliminate from Equations (1) and (3).    Eliminate from your new system.    Form a triangular system and solve by back-substitution.  Solution: Give your answer as an ordered triple.                                                    Pause and Reflect   What should you do if one of the original equations in a 3x3 system is missing one of the variables?        Inconsistent and Dependent Systems  The results in for identifying dependent and inconsistent systems can be extended to linear systems. If at any step in forming linear combinations we obtain an equation of the form then the system is inconsistent and has no solution. If we obtain an equation of the form then the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions.  Solve the system  To eliminate from Equations (1) and (2), we multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (2).                             Since the resulting equation has no solution, the system is inconsistent .  Practice 3   Decide whether the system is inconsistent, dependent, or consistent and independent.     inconsistent    dependent    consistent and independent          Inconsistent       Solve the system  To eliminate from Equations (1) and (3), we multiply Equation (1) by 2 and add Equation (3).                            Since the resulting equation vanishes, the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions.  QuickCheck 3   What does it mean if you obtain an equation of the form     The system has no solution.    The system is dependent.    The solution is .    The system is triangular.          The system has no solution.       Practice 4   Decide whether the system is inconsistent, dependent, or consistent and independent.     inconsistent    dependent    consistent and independent          Dependent       Pause and Reflect   Explain how you know immediately that the following system is dependent:         Applications  Here are some problems that can be modeled by a system of three linear equations. When writing such systems, we must be careful to find three independent equations describing the conditions of the problem.  One angle of a triangle measures less than twice the second angle, and the third angle is greater than the sum of the first two. Find the measure of each angle.    We represent the measure of each angle by a separate variable.  We write the conditions stated in the problem as three equations. (The third equation states the fact that the sum of the angles of a triangle is .)  We follow the steps for solving a linear system.  i. We write the three equations in standard form.   ii-iii. Since Equation (1) has no -term, it will be most efficient to eliminate the variable from Equations (2) and (3). We add these two equations.                                  iv. We form a system from Equations (1) and (4). We add the two equations to eliminate the variable , yielding                           v. We form a triangular system using Equations (3), (1), and (5). We use back-substitution to complete the solution. We divide both sides of Equation (5) by to find . We substitute for in Equation (1) and solve for to find We substitute for and for in Equation (3) to find  The angles measure , , and .   Practice 5   A manufacturer of office supplies makes three types of file cabinet: two-drawer, four-drawer, and horizontal. The manufacturing process is divided into three phases: assembly, painting, and finishing.   A two-drawer cabinet requires 3 hours to assemble, 1 hour to paint, and 1 hour to finish.    The four-drawer model takes 5 hours to assemble, 90 minutes to paint, and 2 hours to finish.    The horizontal cabinet takes 4 hours to assemble, 1 hour to paint, and 3 hours to finish.    The manufacturer employs enough workers for 500 hours of assembly time, 150 hours of painting, and 230 hours of finishing per week. How many of each type of file cabinet should he make in order to use all the hours available?   Represent the number of each model of file cabinet by a different variable.

(Convert all times to hours.)          2-Drawer  4-Drawer  Horizontal  Total available    Assembly        Painting        Finishing        Write three equations describing the time constraints in each of the three manufacturing phases. For example, the assembly phase requires hours for the two-drawer cabinets, hours for the four-drawer cabinets, and hours for the horizontal cabinets, and the sum of these times should be the time available, hours.       Assembly time:      Painting time:      Finishing time:        Solve the system. Follow the steps suggested below.   Clear the fractions from the second equation.  (2)    Subtract Equation (1) from times Equation (3) to obtain a new Equation (4).  (4)    Subtract Equation (2) from twice Equation (3) to obtain a new Equation (5).  (5)    Equations (4) and (5) form a system in and Subtract Equation (5) from Equation (4) to obtain a new Equation (6).  (6)    Form a triangular system with Equations (3), (4), and (6). Use back-substitution to complete the solution.  Enter the solution as an ordered triple.      You should have found the following solution: The manufacturer should make two-drawer cabinets, four-drawer cabinets, and horizontal cabinets.                                                                                                               Assembly time:      Painting time:      Finishing time:      Clear the fractions from the second equation.  then:       so the solution is         Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

The manufacturing process is divided into three phases: assembly, painting, and finishing.   A two-drawer cabinet requires 3 hours to assemble, 1 hour to paint, and 1 hour to finish.    The four-drawer model takes 5 hours to assemble, 90 minutes to paint, and 2 hours to finish.    The horizontal cabinet takes 4 hours to assemble, 1 hour to paint, and 3 hours to finish.    The manufacturer employs enough workers for 500 hours of assembly time, 150 hours of painting, and 230 hours of finishing per week. How many of each type of file cabinet should he make in order to use all the hours available?   Represent the number of each model of file cabinet by a different variable.      Number of two-drawer cabinets:     Number of four-drawer cabinets:     Number of horizontal cabinets:       Organize the information into a table.

  "body": " Solving Linear Systems Using Matrices   In this section, we consider a mathematical tool called a matrix matrix (plural: matrices) that has wide application in mathematics, business, science, and engineering. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or entries entries . These entries are ordinarily displayed in rows and columns, and the entire matrix is enclosed in brackets or parentheses. Thus, are matrices. A matrix of order order , or dimension dimension , (read \" by \") has (horizontal) rows and (vertical) columns.  The matrices above are , , and , respectively. The first matrix—in which the number of rows is equal to the number of columns—is an example of a square matrix square matrix .   Coefficient Matrix and Augmented Matrix of a System  We will use matrices to solve systems of linear equations. For a system of linear equations of the form the matrices are called the coefficient matrix coefficient matrix and the augmented matrix augmented matrix , respectively. Each row of the augmented matrix represents one of the equations of the system. For example, the augmented matrix of the system    is   and the augmented matrix of the system    is   The augmented matrix of this last system, which has all zero entries in the lower left corner (below the diagonal), is said to be in upper triangular form upper triangular form . As we saw in , it is easy to find the solution of such a system by back-substitution.  Pause and Reflect   What is the difference between a coefficient matrix and an augmented matrix?        Elementary Row Operations  The method of elimination depends on two properties of linear systems that allow us to change one system into an equivalent one, that is, one that has the same solutions as the original system.  Properties of Linear Systems   Multiplying a linear equation by a (nonzero) constant does not change its solutions. That is, any solution of the equation is also a solution of the equation  Adding (or subtracting) two linear equations does not change their common solutions. That is, any solution of the system is also a solution of the equation   These properties apply to linear systems of any size. Thus, we can perform the following operations on the equations of a system:  Multiply both sides of an equation by a nonzero real number.  Add a constant multiple of one equation to another equation.  Interchange two equations.  Because each equation of the system corresponds to a row in the augmented matrix, the three operations above correspond to three elementary row operations for the augmented matrix. We can perform one or more of these operations on a matrix without changing the solution of the system it represents.   Elementary Row Operations    Multiply the entries of any row by a nonzero real number.  Add a constant multiple of one row to another row.  Interchange two rows.     QuickCheck 1   Which of the following is not an allowed row operation?    A) Divide the entries in a row by a nonzero number    B) Add two rows together    C) Interchange two elements in a row    D) Interchange the first and last rows          Interchange two elements in a row        and  represent equivalent systems because we can multiply each entry in the second row of by to obtain .  and  represent equivalent systems because we can interchange the first and third rows of to obtain .  and  represent equivalent systems becausewe can add times each entry of the first row of to the corresponding entry of the second row of to obtain .   Practice 1   Subtract times row 2 from row 3.   The new row 3 becomes                                            Use row operations to form an equivalent matrix with the given elements:  To obtain as the first entry in the second row, we can multiply the first row by and add the result to the second row. That is, we add to :  Practice 2   Use row operations to form an equivalent matrix with the given elements:   We add times row 1 to row 2.  The new row 2 becomes                                     Use row operations on the first matrix to form an equivalent matrix in upper triangular form.  We perform the transformation in two steps. First, we obtain zeros in the lower two entries of the first column. We get these zeros by adding suitable multiples of the first row to the second and third rows: Next we obtain a zero as the second entry of the third row by adding a suitable multiple of the second row. For this matrix, we add to : The last matrix is in upper triangular form.  Practice 3   Use the suggested row operations to form an equivalent matrix in upper triangular form.     Add to  The new row 2 becomes                  Add to  The new row 3 becomes                  Multiply by  The new row 2 becomes                  Add to  The new row 3 becomes                                                                                 Matrix Reduction  We use elementary row operations to apply Gaussian reduction to the augmented matrix of a linear system. This matrix method can be used to solve linear systems of any size and is well suited for implementation by a computer program. The method has three steps.   Solving a Linear System by Matrix Reduction    Write the augmented matrix for the system.  Using elementary row operations, transform the matrix into an equivalent one in upper triangular form.  Use back-substitution to find the solution to the system.     Use matrix reduction to solve the system.  The augmented matrix is We use row operations to obtain in the first entry of the second row. The last matrix is upper triangular and corresponds to the system Now we use back-substitution to solve the system. From Equation (2), . Substitute for in Equation (1) to find The solution is the ordered pair .  Practice 4   Use matrix reduction to solve the system   Follow the suggested steps:   Write the augmented matrix for the system.    Add to    Solve the resulting system by back-substitution.    Solution: Give the solution as an ordered pair.              Pause and Reflect   Why do we want to put a matrix into upper triangular form?        Reducing a Matrix  Although there are many ways to reduce an augmented matrix to upper triangular form, the following two-step procedure may help you organize the row operations.   Strategy for Matrix Reduction    If the first entry in the first row is zero, interchange that row with another. Obtain zeros in the first entries of the second and third rows by adding suitable multiples of the first row to the second and third rows.  If the second entry of the second row is zero, interchange the second and third rows. Obtain a zero in the second entry of the third row by adding a suitable multiple of the second row to the third row.     If you cannot obtain nonzero entries on the diagonal, then the system does not have a unique solution; the system is either inconsistent or dependent. See Homework Problems 45 48.  QuickCheck 2   What happens if we cannot obtain nonzero entries on the diagonal?    A) There is no solution.    B) There is no unique solution.    C) We should reduce the matrix.    D) We should augment the matrix.          There is no unique solution.       Use matrix reduction to solve the system.  The augmented matrix is We obtain as the first entry of the first row by multiplying each entry in the first row by . This will make it easier to obtain zeros in the first entries of the second and third rows.            Next, we obtain zeros in the first entries of the second and third rows by adding suitable multiples of the first row:       Finally, we obtain a zero in the second entry of the third row by adding to :      The system is now in upper triangular form, and we use back-substitution to find the solution. We solve the last equation to get and substitute for in the second equation to find . Finally, we substitute for and for in the first equation to find . The solution is the ordered triple .   Practice 5   Use matrix reduction to solve the system   Follow the suggested steps:   Write the augmented matrix for the system.    Add (row 1) to (row 2).    Add (row 1) to (row 3).    Add (row 2) to (row 3).    Solve the resulting system by back-substitution.    Solution: Give the solution as an ordered triple.              It is a good idea to make the first entry in the first row equal to , as we did in , to simplify the calculations that follow. However, if that entry is zero we can interchange two rows. For example, to reduce the matrix we begin by interchanging the first and second rows to obtain We then follow the two-step procedure described above to find  QuickCheck 3   What should you do if the first entry in the first row is zero?    Interchange two columns    Interchange two rows    Add the first row to the second row    Obtain zeros below that entry          Interchange two rows        Solving Larger Systems  Systems of linear equations in business and economics may involve hundreds of linear equations and hundreds of variables. The study of airflow for aircraft design can involve systems of millions of linear equations and variables. These large systems are solved using matrix methods.  Write the augmented matrix for the system Use matrix reduction and back-substitution to solve the system.  The augmented matrix is We use row operations to put the matrix in upper triangular form. First, we add multiples of the first row to the rows below it to get s in the first column.         The second row has as its second entry, so we interchange the second and third rows to put a nonzero entry in the second column. Now we want s in the last two rows of the second column. The third row already has in the second column, so we only need to add a multiple of the second row to the fourth row.         Finally, we add a multiple of the third row to the fourth row to get 0 in the third column.         This triangular matrix corresponds to the system which we solve by back-substitution.  From the last equation, we find , and by substituting for in the third equation, we find . Next, we substitute for and for in the second equation to find , and finally, we substitute , , into the first equation to find .  The solution is the ordered four-tuple . We can verify that these values satisfy all four equations of the original system.  Our strategy for reducing augmented matrices can be generalized for larger matrices, as demonstrated in . Starting with the first row, we work our way along the diagonal, using row operations to obtain nonzero entries on the diagonal and zeros below the diagonal entry.  Practice 6   Use matrix reduction to solve the system   Solution: Give the solution as an ordered 4-tuple.              Pause and Reflect   How is matrix reduction similar to Gaussian reduction?        Reduced Row Echelon Form  The triangular matrix we obtain by row reduction is an example of row echelon form row echelon form . In a row echelon matrix,  The first nonzero entry in any row is farther to the right than the first nonzero entry in the rows above it.  The entries directly below the first nonzero entry in any row are all zeros.  Any row consisting entirely of zeros is below all rows with any nonzero entry.  If we divide each row by its leading nonzero entry, so that the leading entry is , and if we use row reduction to obtain 0's above the leading as well as below it, the resulting matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form reduced row echelon form . This form is especially convenient because we do not have to use back-substitution to finish solving the system; we can read off the solutions directly from the matrix.  For example, you can check that the matrix corresponds to the system From this system, it is easy to read the solutions , , , and  QuickCheck 4   Why is reduced row echelon form useful?    A) It makes the elements in each row smaller.    B) It lets us read the solutions of a system.    C) It reduces the number of rows.    D) It solves the matrix.          It lets us read the solutions of a system.        Graphing calculators and other graphing utilitiues typically have a command for finding the reduced row echelon form of a matrix.  Solve the system by finding the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix.  The augmented matrix is We enter this matrix into the calculator as follows: First access the MATRIX menu by pressing 2nd  on a TI-84 or MATRX on a TI-83. You will see the menu shown in figure (a). We will use matrix [A], which is already selected, and we presss   ENTER to EDIT (or enter) the matrix, shown in figure(b).  GC windows to edit or create a matrix  We want to enter a matrix, so we press ENTER ENTER , and we see the display in figure (a) below. Now type in the first row of the matrix, pressing ENTER after each entry. The calculator automatically moves to the second row. Continue filling in the rest of the augmented matrix, as shown in figure (b).  GC windows of matrices being edited  To make sure you have entered the values correctly, press 2nd MODE to quit to the home screen, then open the matrix menu again. Press ENTER to retrieve matrix [A]; the calculator display should look like figure (a) below. To check the rest of the matrix, press the right arrow key until you see the last column, as in figure (b).  GC windows scrolling to see a matrix  Now we are ready to compute the reduced row echelon form of the matrix. Access the matrix menu again, but this time press the right arrow once to highlight MATH as shown in figure (a). Scroll down until the rref( command is highlighted, as shown in figure (b), and press ENTER .  GC windows to manipulate a matrix  Finally, enter matrix [A] after the rref( command by pressing 2nd   )  ENTER or  )  ENTER . The display should now look like figure (a) below. The last column of the matrix gives decimal approximations for the solutions.  GC windows showing rref   The calculator can also display the rational form of the solutions: Press MATH  ENTER  ENTER to see figure(b). The reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix is thus and the solution is the ordered four-tuple . You can verify that these values satisfy each of the original four equations.

Each row of the matrix consists of the coefficients in one of the equations of the system.  We operate on a matrix by using the elementary row operations.   Elementary Row Operations    Multiply the entries of any row by a nonzero real number.  Add a constant multiple of one row to another row.  Interchange two rows.     We can solve a linear system by matrix reduction.   Solving a Linear System by Matrix Reduction    Write the augmented matrix for the system.  Using elementary row operations, transform the matrix into an equivalent one in upper triangular form.  Use back-substitution to find the solution to the system.      Strategy for Matrix Reduction    If the first entry in the first row is zero, interchange that row with another. Obtain zeros in the first entries of the second and third rows by adding suitable multiples of the first row to the second and third rows.  If the second entry of the second row is zero, interchange the second and third rows. Obtain a zero in the second entry of the third row by adding a suitable multiple of the second row to the third row.     To reduce larger matrices, we start with the first row and work our way along the diagonal, using row operations to obtain nonzero entries on the diagonal and zeros below the diagonal entry.

The augmented matrix is We use row operations to put the matrix in upper triangular form. First, we add multiples of the first row to the rows below it to get s in the first column.         The second row has as its second entry, so we interchange the second and third rows to put a nonzero entry in the second column. Now we want s in the last two rows of the second column. The third row already has in the second column, so we only need to add a multiple of the second row to the fourth row.         Finally, we add a multiple of the third row to the fourth row to get 0 in the third column.         This triangular matrix corresponds to the system which we solve by back-substitution.

  "body": " Linear Inequalities   In this section, we study linear inequalities in two variables and how they arise in applications.  Graphs of Inequalities in Two Variables  Ivana is investing in the hotel business. She has bought two hotels, and she will expand her investments when her total profit from the two hotels exceeds . If we let represent the profit from one hotel and let represent the profit from the other, then Ivana will expand her investments when Notice that the equation is not appropriate to model our situation, since Ivana will be delighted if her profits are not exactly equal to but actually exceed that amount.  A solution solution to an inequality in two variables is an ordered pair of numbers that satisfies the inequality. The graph of the inequality must show all the points whose coordinates are solutions. As an example, let us graph the inequality above, .  Rewrite the inequality by subtracting from both sides to get This inequality says that for each -value, we must choose points with -values greater than or equal to . For example, when , we must choose points with -values greater than or equal to . Solutions for several choices of are shown in figure (a).  linear inequality in two variables  A more efficient way to find all the solutions of the inequality is to start with the graph of the corresponding equation The graph is a straight line, as illustrated in figure (b). Observe that any point above this line has a y-coordinate greater than and hence satisfies the inequality. Thus, the graph of the inequality includes all the points on or above the line , as shown by the shaded region in figure (b).  You can check that the shaded points are also solutions to the original inequality, . Consider the point , which lies in the shaded region above the line. This pair does satisfy , because (Ivana will expand her investments if her first hotel loses $ and her second has a profit of $ .) On the other hand, the point does not lie in the graph of , because the coordinates do not satisfy the inequality.   Linear Inequalities  A linear inequality linear inequality can be written in the form The solutions consist of the line and a half-plane half-plane on one side of that line. We shade the half-plane to show that all its points are included in the solution set. If the inequality is strict, then the graph includes only the half-plane and not the line. In that case, we use a dashed line for the graph of the equation to show that it is not part of the solution.  To decide which side of the line to shade, we can solve the inequality for in terms of . If we obtain then we shade the half-plane above the line. If the inequality is equivalent to then we shade the half-plane below the line.  Be careful when isolating : We must remember to reverse the direction of the inequality whenever we multiply or divide by a negative number. (See Algebra Skills Refresher if you would like to review solving inequalities.)  Graph  We solve the inequality for . We graph the corresponding line Note that the -intercept is and the slope is . (See to review the slope-intercept method of graphing.) Finally, we shade the half-plane below the line. The completed graph is shown below.  linear inequality in two variables  Practice 1     Find one -value that satisfies the inequality for each of the -values in the table.                      Graph the line Then plot your solutions from part (a) on the same grid.    Graph the solutions of the inequality                                          (Many answers are possible.)

Above    Below    To the left    To the right          To the right        Using a Test Point  A second method for graphing inequalities does not require us to solve for . Once we have graphed the boundary line, we can decide which half-plane to shade by using a test point. The test point can be any point that is not on the boundary line itself.  Graph the solutions of the inequality   First, we graph the line , as shown below. We will use the intercept method. The intercepts are and , so we sketch the boundary line through those points.  Next, we choose a test point. Because does not lie on the line, we choose it as our test point. We substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality to obtain Because this is a true statement, is a solution of the inequality. Since all the solutions lie on the same side of the boundary line, we shade the half-plane that contains the test point. In this example, the boundary line is a dashed line because the original inequality was strict.  strict linear inequality in two variables  We can choose any point for the test point as long as it does not lie on the boundary line. We chose in because the coordinates are easy to substitute into the inequality. If the test point is a solution to the inequality, then the half-plane including that point should be shaded. If the test point is not a solution to the inequality, then the other half-plane should be shaded.  For example, suppose we had chosen as the test point in . When we substitute its coordinates into the inequality, we find which is a false statement. This tells us that is not a solution to the inequality, so the solutions must lie on the other side of the boundary line. Using as the test point gives us the same solutions we found in .  QuickCheck 2   Which point would not be a good test point for the inequality ?                      would not be a good test point because it lies on the boundary line.       Here is a summary of our test point method for graphing inequalities.   To Graph an Inequality Using a Test Point:    Graph the corresponding equation to obtain the boundary line.  Choose a test point that does not lie on the boundary line.  Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality.

Graph of inequality:  linear inequality in two variables   Recall that the equation of a vertical line has the form where is a constant, and a horizontal line has an equation of the form Similarly, the inequality may represent the inequality in two variables Its graph is then a region in the plane.  Graph in the plane.  First, we graph the equation ; its graph is a vertical line. Because the origin does not lie on this line, we can use it as a test point. Substitute for (there is no ) into the inequality to obtain Since this is a false statement, we shade the half-plane that does not contain the origin. We see in the figure below that the graph of the inequality contains all points whose -coordinates are greater than or equal to .  graph of x greater or equal to 2 in the plane  Practice 3 Graph in the plane. linear compound inequality in two variables   Systems of Inequalities   Some applications are best described by a system of two or more inequalities. The solutions to a system of inequalities include all points that are solutions to each inequality in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system. For example, the figure at right shows the solutions of the system    system of two inequalities     Laura is a finicky eater, and she dislikes most foods that are high in calcium. Her morning cereal satisfies some of her calcium requirements, but she needs an additional 500 milligrams of calcium, which she will get from a combination of broccoli, at 160 milligrams per serving, and zucchini, at 30 milligrams per serving. Draw a graph representing the possible combinations of broccoli and zucchini that fulfill Laura’s calcium requirements.    Number of servings of broccoli:  Number of servings of zucchini:  To consume at least milligrams of calcium, Laura must choose and so that It makes no sense to consider negative values of or of , since Laura cannot eat a negative number of servings. Thus, we have two more inequalities to satisfy:  We graph all three inequalities on the same axes. The inequalities and restrict the solutions to lie in the first quadrant. The solutions common to all three inequalities are shown below.    system of three inequalities    Laura can choose any combination of broccoli and zucchini represented by points in the shaded region. For example, the point is a solution to the system of inequalities, so Laura could choose to eat servings of broccoli and serving of zucchini.

To describe the solutions of a system of inequalities, it is useful to locate the vertices vertices , or corner points, of the boundary.  Graph the solution set of the system below and find the coordinates of its vertices.  The last two inequalities, and , restrict the solutions to the first quadrant.

Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.  Half-plane  Test point  Vertices     CONCEPTS    The solutions of a linear inequality in two variables consist of a half-plane on one side of the line. The line itself is not included if the inequality is strict.  Once we have graphed the boundary line, we can decide which half-plane to shade by using a test point .   To Graph an Inequality Using a Test Point:    Graph the corresponding equation to obtain the boundary line.  Choose a test point that does not lie on the boundary line.  Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality.  If the resulting statement is true, shade the half-plane that includes the test point.  If the resulting statement is false, shade the half-plane that does not include the test point.  If the inequality is strict, make the boundary line a dashed line.     The solutions to a system of inequalities include all points that are solutions to each inequality in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system.  To describe the solutions of a system of inequalities, it is useful to locate the vertices , or corner points, of the boundary.    STUDY QUESTIONS   The solutions of a linear inequality in two variables form what sort of set?  How can you find the boundary of the solution set?  If your test point is not a solution of the inequality, which side of the line should you shade?  How can you find the vertices of the solution set of a system of inequalities?

  "body": " Linear Programming   The term linear programming linear programming was coined in the late 1940s. It describes a relatively young branch of mathematics, compared to subjects such as Euclidean geometry, where the major ideas were already well understood 23 centuries ago. (The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote what can be considered the first geometry textbook about 300 B.C.) Business managers routinely solve linear programming problems for purchasing and marketing strategy, so it is possible that linear programming affects your daily life as much as any other branch of mathematics.  The Objective Function and Constraints  TrailGear would like to maximize its profit from selling hiking boots. The company produces two kinds of hiking boots, a Weekender model, on which it makes $ profit per pair, and a Sierra model, on which it makes $ profit per pair. How many of each model should TrailGear produce each week in order to maximize its profit?  If we let represent the number of Weekender boots and the number of Sierra boots TrailGear produces, then the total weekly profit is given by This expression for is called the objective function objective function . The goal of a linear programming problem is to maximize or minimize such an objective function, subject to one or more constraints.  If TrailGear had infinite resources and an infinite market, there would be no limit to the profit it could earn by producing more and more hiking boots. However, every business has to consider many factors, including its supplies of labor and materials, overhead and shipping costs, and the size of the market for its product. To keep things simple, we will concentrate on just two of these factors.  Each pair of Weekender boots requires hours of labor to produce, and each pair of Sierra boots requires hours. TrailGear has available hours of labor per week. Thus, and must satisfy the inequality In addition, suppose that TrailGear's suppliers can provide at most ounces of silicone gel each week, with each pair of Weekenders using ounces and each Sierra model using ounce. This means that Of course, we will also require that and . These four inequalities are called the constraints constraints of the problem.  QuickCheck 1   Which of these could be an objective function?                             Feasible Solutions  We have formulated the original problem into an objective function and a system of inequalities called the constraints.  Our goal is to find values for and that satisfy the constraints and produce the maximum value for . We begin by graphing the solutions to the constraint inequalities. These solutions are shown in the shaded region in at right. The points in this region are called feasible solutions feasible solutions because they are the only values we can consider while looking for the maximum value of the objective function .  system of inequalities defining the feasible solutions     Verify that the points and represent feasible solutions for the problem above. Show that is not a feasible solution.  Find the values of the objective function at the two feasible solutions in part (a).     The two points and lie within the shaded region above, but does not. We can also verify that the coordinates of and satisfy each of the constraint inequalities.  For , we have For , we have   QuickCheck 2   What is the set of feasible solutions?    A) The vertices of the solution set    B) The values of the objective function    C) The set of points that satisfy the constraints    D) The boundary lines of the inequalities          The set of points that satisfy the constraints is the set of feasible solutions.       Practice 1     Determine which of the points   and represent feasible solutions for the TrailGear problem.  Separate different ordered pairs with a comma.    Find the values of the objective function at the feasible solutions in part (a).  At  At  At                            and    At  at  at          Pause and Reflect   Explain how to find the set of feasible solutions.        The Optimum Solutions  We cannot check all of the feasible solutions to see which one results in the largest profit. Fortunately, there is a simple way to find the optimal solution optimal solution .  Consider the objective function, Suppose TrailGear would like to make on hiking. It could produce pairs of Sierra boots, or pairs of Weekenders. Or it could produce some of each; for example, pairs of Weekenders and pairs of Sierra boots. In fact, every point on the line represents a combination of Weekenders and Sierra boots that will yield a profit of $ . This line is labeled in the figure below.  lines of constant objective function drawn over feasible solutions  If TrailGear would like to make $ on boots, it should choose a point on the line labeled . Similarly, all the points on the line labeled will yield a profit of $ , and so on. Different values of correspond to parallel lines on the graph. Smaller values of correspond to lines near the origin, and larger values of have lines farther from the origin.  QuickCheck 3   What is an optimal solution?

Is it possible for a feasible solution to result in an objective value of 45?    The objective value at the point is Another point with the same objective value is . In fact, all points on the line have an objective value of . This line intersects the set of feasible solutions in a line segment, as shown in below. Thus, there are infinitely many feasible solutions with objective value .  system of inequalities defining the feasible solutions  Points that give an objective value of lie on the line , as shown in the figure. There are infinitely many feasible solutions that lie on this line; for example, one such point is .  The line intersects the set of feasible solutions in only one point, the point . This is the only feasible solution that yields an objective value of .  The line includes all points for which . This line does not intersect the set of feasible solutions, as we see in the figure. Thus, there are no feasible solutions that result in an objective value of .   Practice 2     Returning to this section s opening Example regarding TrailGear profits for selling hiking boots, find all feasible solutions for which the objective function has a value of    Find all feasible solutions that result in an objective value of                    None         We are only allowed to choose points from the set of feasible solutions. Imagine the parallel lines representing different values of the objective function sweeping across the graph of the feasible solutions. The objective values increase as the lines sweep up across the graph.  What is the last feasible solution the lines intersect before leaving the shaded region? If you study the preceding examples, perhaps you can see that the largest (and smallest) values of the objective function will occur at corner points of the set of feasible solutions. We have not proved this fact, but it is true.  Linear Programming  The maximum and the minimum values of the objective function always occur at vertices of the graph of feasible solutions.   Depending on the exact formula for the objective function, the maximum and minimum values may occur at any of the vertices of the shaded region.  Find TrailGear's maximum weekly profit.  The figure below shows the lines corresponding to the objective values , , and .  system of inequalities defining the feasible solutions  The maximum value of the profit, , corresponds to the topmost line that intersects the region of feasible solutions. This is the line that passes through the vertex where the lines and intersect, namely the vertex at . The profit for that point is so the maximum weekly profit is .

To Solve a Linear Programming Problem:    Represent the unknown quantities by variables. Write the objective function and the constraints in terms of the variables.  Graph the solutions to the constraint inequalities.  Find the coordinates of each vertex of the solution set.  Evaluate the objective function at each vertex.  The maximum and minimum values of the objective function occur at vertices of the set of feasible solutions.     QuickCheck 4   Linear programming is used to    A) find the vertices of a region.    B) solve a system of inequalities.    C) write a set of inequalities in two variables.    D) find an optimal solution subject to a set of constraints.          find an optimal solution subject to a set of constraints.       In , the set of feasible solutions is an unbounded region.  Each week, the Healthy Food Store buys both granola and muesli in bulk from two cereal companies. The store requires at least kilograms of granola and kilograms of muesli.  Company A charges $ for a package that contains kilograms of granola and kilogram of muesli.  Company B charges $ for a package of kilograms of granola and kilograms of muesli.  How much should the Healthy Food Store purchase from each company in order to minimize its costs and still meet its needs for granola and muesli? What is the minimum cost?     First, we write the objective function. The store would like to minimize its cost, so Next, we write the constraints. These will be a system of inequalities. It may help to organize the information into a table.     Company A  Company B  Required   Granola    12   Muesli    9   The Healthy Food Store will have kilograms of granola and kilograms of muesli from Company A, and kilograms of granola and kilograms of muesli from Company B. The store requires that Because the store cannot purchase negative quantities, we also have  We graph the solutions to the constraint system. The feasible solutions form the shaded region shown below. Any ordered point on this graph corresponds to a way to purchase granola and muesli that meets the store’s needs, but some of these choices cost more than others.     unbounded set of feasible solutions    We know that the minimum cost will occur at one of the vertex points, which are labeled in the figure. The coordinates of and are easy to see. To find the coordinates of , we notice that it is the intersection of the lines and . Thus, we must solve the system Subtracting the second equation from the first, we find that . Substituting this value into either of the original two equations, we find that . Thus the point has coordinates .  Now we evaluate the objective function at each of the three vertices. The minimum cost occurs at point .  The Healthy Food Store should buy three packages from Company A and two packages from Company B. It will pay $ for its stock of granola and muesli.    Practice 4   Find the maximum value of the objective function, subject to the constraints   Answer:        The maximum value is (which occurs at the vertex ).       Pause and Reflect   What fact helps us find the optimal solution?       Using a Graphing Calculator  You can use your graphing calculator to solve the problem in . Set the window values at Next, graph the set of feasible solutions. We have already taken care of the constraints and by setting Xmin and Ymin to zero. Solve each of the other constraints for to get For each constraint, the set of feasible solutions lies above the boundary line, because is greater than the expression in .

Your display should look like figure (b).  GCdisplays for graphing systems of inequalities  The feasible solutions lie in the crosshatched region that is shaded with both the vertical and horizontal lines. We will use the calculator to evaluate the objective function at each vertex. First, use the TRACE (or value or intersect feature) to find the coordinates of one of the vertices, say . Then press 2nd  QUIT to get back to the Home screen; enter the formula for the objective function by keying in (Enter by pressing ALPHA  .) Your calculator has stored the values and from the TRACE key, so when you press ENTER , the calculator returns for the value of at that point. Thus, when and , .  Similarly, you can verify that when and , and that when and , . Thus, the minimum cost of occurs when and .    Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

  "title": "Chapter Summary and Review",
  "body": " Chapter Summary and Review  Key Concepts    We can solve a linear system by graphing. The solution is the intersection point of the two graphs.  A linear system may be inconsistent (has no solution), dependent (has infinitely many solutions), or consistent and independent (has one solution).   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems    If an equation of the form is obtained as a linear combination of the equations in a system, the system is inconsistent inconsistent .  If an equation of the form is obtained as a linear combination of the equations in a system, the system is dependent dependent .     We can use a system of equations to solve problems involving two unknown quantities.  In economics, the price at which the supply and demand are equal is called the equilibrium price .  The solution to a linear system is an ordered triple .  A system in triangular form can be solved by back-substitution .  Gaussian reduction is a generalized form of the elimination method that can be used to reduce a linear system to triangular form.   Steps for Solving a Linear System    Clear each equation of fractions and put it in standard form.  Choose two of the equations and eliminate one of the variables by forming a linear combination.  Choose a different pair of equations and eliminate the same variable.  Form a system with the equations found in steps (2) and (3). Eliminate one of the variables from this system by using a linear combination.  Form a triangular system by choosing among the previous equations. Use back-substitution to solve the triangular system.     linear systems may be inconsistent or dependent .  We can use a matrix to represent a system of linear equations. Each row of the matrix consists of the coefficients in one of the equations of the system.  We operate on a matrix by using the elementary row operations.   Elementary Row Operations    Multiply the entries of any row by a nonzero real number.  Add a constant multiple of one row to another row.  Interchange two rows.     We can solve a linear system by matrix reduction.   Solving a Linear System by Matrix Reduction    Write the augmented matrix for the system.  Using elementary row operations, transform the matrix into an equivalent one in upper triangular form.  Use back-substitution to find the solution to the system.      Strategy for Matrix Reduction    If the first entry in the first row is zero, interchange that row with another. Obtain zeros in the first entries of the second and third rows by adding suitable multiples of the first row to the second and third rows.  If the second entry of the second row is zero, interchange the second and third rows. Obtain a zero in the second entry of the third row by adding a suitable multiple of the second row to the third row.     To reduce larger matrices, we start with the first row and work our way along the diagonal, using row operations to obtain nonzero entries on the diagonal and zeros below the diagonal entry.  The solutions of a linear inequality in two variables consist of a half-plane on one side of the line. The line itself is not included if the inequality is strict.  Once we have graphed the boundary line, we can decide which half-plane to shade by using a test point .   To Graph an Inequality Using a Test Point:    Graph the corresponding equation to obtain the boundary line.  Choose a test point that does not lie on the boundary line.  Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality.  If the resulting statement is true, shade the half-plane that includes the test point.  If the resulting statement is false, shade the half-plane that does not include the test point.  If the inequality is strict, make the boundary line a dashed line.     The solutions to a system of inequalities include all points that are solutions to each inequality in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system  To describe the solutions of a system of inequalities, it is useful to locate the vertices , or corner points, of the boundary.  Linear programming is a technique for finding the maximum or minimum value of an objective function , subject to a system of constraints .  The optimum solution occurs at one of the vertices of the set of feasible solutions .   To Solve a Linear Programming Problem:    Represent the unknown quantities by variables. Write the objective function and the constraints in terms of the variables.  Graph the solutions to the constraint inequalities.  Find the coordinates of each vertex of the solution set.  Evaluate the objective function at each vertex.  The maximum and minimum values of the objective function occur at vertices of the set of feasible solutions.     .     Chapter 8 Review Problems  For Problems 1 2, solve the system by graphing. Use the ZDecimal window.     For Problems 3 6, solve the system using substitution or elimination.       For Problems 7 10, decide whether the system is inconsistent, dependent, or consistent and independent.  Consistent and independent   Dependent    For Problems 11 16, solve the system using Gaussian reduction.         For Problems 17 22, use matrix reduction to solve the system.         For Problems 23 26, solve the system by finding the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix.       For Problems 27 32, solve the problem by writing and solving a system of linear equations in two or three variables.  A math contest exam has 40 questions.

The table gives data for two types of average, the mean and the median, for the ages of women. (Consult the Glossary for the definitions of mean and median .)

Plot the data for mean age versus date on the same axes. Draw a line that fits the data.  Use your graph to estimate when the mean age and the median age will be the same.  For the data given, the mean age of women in the United States is greater than the median age. What does this tell you about the U.S. population of women?

Find an equation for the line you graphed in part (b), median age versus date.  Find an equation for the line you graphed in part (d), mean age versus date.  Solve the system of equations algebraically. How does your answer compare to the solution you found by graphing?   Salinity and freezing point Water slowly contracts as it cools, causing it to become denser, until just before freezing, when the density decreases slightly. The salinity of water affects its freezing point and also the temperature at which it reaches its maximum density: The higher the salinity, the lower the temperature at which the maximum density occurs. Pure water is densest at C and freezes at C. Water that is saline is densest at C and freezes at C.  Write an equation for the water's temperature of maximum density in terms of its salinity in percent.  Write an equation for the water's freezing point in terms of its salinity in percent.  Graph the system of equations.  Solve the system to find the salinity of water that freezes when it is densest. What is the freezing point?   Charles's Law Charles's law says that the temperature of a gas is related to its volume by a linear equation. A gas that occupied one liter at C expanded to liters at a temperature of C. A second sample of gas that occupied liters at C expanded to liters at C.  Find a linear equation for temperature, , in terms of volume, , for the first sample of gas, and a second linear equation for the second sample of gas.  Graph the system of equations.  Solve the system. What is the significance of the intersection point?  Show that both equations from part (a) can be written in the form , where is the volume of the gas at C.   Grazing animals spend most of their time foraging for food. A small animal such as a ground squirrel must also be alert for predators.Which foraging strategy favors survival: Should the animal look for foods that satisfy its dietary requirements in minimum time, thus minimizing its exposure to predators and the elements, or should it try to maximize its intake of nutrients?  Ground Squirrels The Columbian ground squirrel eats forb, a type of flowering weed, and grass. One gram of forb provides kilocalories, and one gram of grass provides kilocalories. For survival, the squirrel needs at least kilocalories per day. However, the squirrel can digest no more than wet grams of food daily. Each dry gram of forb becomes wet grams in the squirrel's stomach, and each dry gram of grass becomes wet grams. In addition, the squirrel has at most minutes available for grazing each day. It takes the squirrel minutes to eat one gram of forb and minutes to eat one gram of grass.  Write a system of inequalities for the number of grams of grass and forb the squirrel can eat and survive.  Graph the system.  Give two possible combinations of grass and forb that satisfy the squirrel's feeding requirements.  If the squirrel can find only grass on a given day, how much grass will it need to eat? If the squirrel can find only forb, how much forb will it need?   Isle Royale Moose The Isle Royale moose eats deciduous leaves, which provide kilocalories of energy per gram, and aquatic plants, which provide kilocalories per gram. The moose needs at least kilocalories of food per day, and its daily sodium requirement must be met by consuming at least grams of aquatic plants. It takes the moose minute to eat one gram of aquatic plants and minute to eat each gram of leaves. To maintain its thermal balance, the moose cannot spend more than minutes each day standing in water and eating aquatics plants, or more than minutes eating leaves. Each gram of aquatic plants becomes wet grams in the moose's stomach, and each gram of leaves becomes wet grams, and the stomach can hold no more than wet grams of food daily.  Write a system of inequalities for the number of grams of aquatic plants and of leaves the moose can eat.  Graph the system.  Give two possible combinations of aquatic plants and leaves that satisfy the moose’s feeding requirements.  Can the moose survive by eating only aquatic plants?   Ground Squirrels Part II described the diet of the Colombian ground squirrel. Refer to the system of constraints and the set of feasible solutions you found in that problem.  Write a formula for the squirrel’s energy consumption. What is the optimum diet for the squirrel if it wants to maximize its energy consumption? Round your answers to one decimal place.  Write a formula for the squirrel's foraging time. What is the optimum diet for the squirrel if it wants to minimize its time foraging? Round your answer to one decimal place.  The actual observed diet of the squirrel consists of approximately grams of forb and grams of grass. Does the squirrel appear to be trying to maximize its caloric intake or to minimize its time eating? (Because of the food available to the squirrel is grass, its diet is not determined by convenience.)   Isle Royale Moose Part II described the diet of the Isle Royale moose. Refer to the system of constraints and the set of feasible solutions you found in that problem.  Write a formula for the moose's energy consumption. What is the optimum diet for the moose if it wants to maximize its energy consumption? Round your answers to one decimal place.  Write a formula for the moose's foraging time.

She begins a training schedule in which she swims 20 laps a day for the first week and increases that number by 6 laps each week. The table below gives the first few values of the function.    Week            Number of Laps            The function makes sense only for input values that are positive integers. We would not ask how many laps Gwynn swims in week 4.63, or in week .  A function whose inputs are a set of successive positive integers is called a sequence . Most people think of a sequence as a list of objects in which the order is important, and we often present a mathematical sequence in just that way. The information in the table above can be displayed more simply by listing only the output values, in order: When we list them in this way, the output values are called the terms of the sequence. The input values are indicated implicitly by the position of the term. For example, the third term of the sequence, 32, is the value of .  We often use the notation instead of to refer to the terms of a sequence. Thus, and so on.   Let be the number of seats in the row of a theater.

For some savings accounts, interest is posted only once a year.  You deposit $8000 in a savings account that pays 5% interest compounded annually. How much money will be in the account at the end of each of the next 4 years?  During the first year the account will earn 5% of $8000, or dollars. Thus, at the end of the first year the account will contain the original $8000 plus the $400 interest for a total of $8400.  At the end of the second year the account will have the $8400 from the previous year, plus 5% of $8400, or dollars in interest. We can write this sum as Thus, at the end of the second year there will be in the account.  In fact, each new balance is found by multiplying the previous balance by 1.05.

You deposit $8000 in a savings account that pays 5% simple annual interest. (The interest is earned only on the initial $8000 and not compounded.) How much money will be in the account at the end of each of the next 4 years?  The account earns 5% of $8000 or dollars during the first year. At the end of the first year the account will contain the original $8000 plus $400 interest for a total of $8400. During the second year interest will be earned only on the initial $8000 deposited, for another 400 dollars. So at the end of the second year the account will have the $8400 from the previous year plus $400 interest, for a total of In fact, the balance at the end of each succeeding year is found by adding $400 simple interest to the previous balance.

For example, an equilateral triangle and a square are regular polygons. All the interior angles in a regular polygon are equal also. Find the general term for the sequence that gives the size of an interior angle in a regular polygon of sides.    regular polygons      This sequence starts with because we cannot have a polygon with fewer than three sides. We already know the values of and : each angle in an equilateral triangle is , and each angle in a square is . We would like to find a formula for the size of the angles in any regular polygon.  If we can find the sum of all the angles in a regular polygon, we can divide by to find the size of each. (You can check that this idea works for the equilateral triangle and the square.) To find the sum of the angles, notice that any polygon can be partitioned into triangles, as shown below.   regular polygons    By sketching some examples, convince yourself that every polygon of sides (for ) can be partitioned into triangles. Because the angles in every triangle add up to , the sum of the angles in an -sided polygon is times . To find the size of just one of the angles, we divide the sum by .

A sequence in which each term can be obtained from the previous term by adding a fixed amount is called an arithmetic sequence .

That is, we can find a formula for the general term. Consider an arithmetic sequence with first term and common difference . The Thus, we have the following property.  Arithmetic Sequence  The term of an arithmetic sequence is  We can use this formula to find a particular term of an arithmetic sequence if we know the first term and the common difference.  Find the fourteenth term of the arithmetic sequence  First, we find the common difference by subtracting any term from its successor: Then we use the formula with :   Practice 2   Find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence  Answer:              You deposit $8000 in an account that pays 5% simple annual interest.   Find a formula for the amount of money in the account after years.  How much money will be in the account after 20 years?   Each year, 0.05(8000) or $400 interest is added to the account balance. Thus, the annual balances, , form an arithmetic sequence whose first term is 8400 and whose common difference is 400. Hence,  We substitute into the formula for the general term found in part (a).

At the end of each round, the winners move on to the next level. Thus, after each round there are half as many contestants as before, and the number of remaining contestants is a function of the number of rounds completed. Because the number of rounds is a positive integer, the function is a sequence.  If represents the number of contestants after rounds of competition, then In general  Each term of the sequence defined above can be obtained from the previous one by multiplying by . A sequence in which each term can be obtained from the previous term by multiplying by a fixed amount is called a geometric sequence .  The fixed amount we multiply each term by is the ratio of two successive terms and is called the common ratio . In the example above the common ratio is . If we denote the first term of a geometric sequence by and the common ratio by , then the sequence can be defined recursively by  Find the first four terms of a geometric sequence whose first term is 64 and whose common ratio is .

  "body": " Series  Introduction  Often we are more interested in the sum of a sequence than in the sequence itself. For example, suppose that for 5 years you have made payments of $100 a month into a savings account that pays 12% annual interest compounded monthly. The sequence gives the current value of the payment you made months ago (plus interest). However, you are probably more interested in the total amount in your savings account, which is the sum of the terms from to .  The sum of the terms of a sequence is called a series .  Although the words \"sequence\" and \"series\" are often used interchangeably in everyday English, they have different meanings in mathematics. A sequence is a list of numbers, whereas a series is a single number obtained by computing a sum. For example, the list of numbers is a sequence. The sum of those five terms is the series   QuickCheck 1   What is the difference between a sequence and a series?    A) The order of the terms in a series is important, but not in a sequence.    B) A sequence is a list of numbers, and a series is a single number.    C) A series can be used in applications.    D) There is no difference; they are the same.          A sequence is a list of numbers, and a series is a single number.       We use the symbol to denote the sum of the first terms of a sequence. Thus, for the sequence in , .   Find the series for the sequence with general term .   The first six terms of the sequence are     and Thus,   Practice 1   Find the series for the sequence with general term                Arithmetic Series  We can find a formula for the sum of the first terms of an arithmetic sequence.  Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence  Consider the sum of the first 12 terms of the sequence with general term . That is, In mathematics, as in other fields, making discoveries often depends on looking at familiar objects in a new way.   Let's write the terms of the series in the opposite order:  Now add these two equations term by term, to find  Each term of the sum is the same, namely, 54! (Do you see why?) Also, the term 54 occurs 12 times because we are adding 12 terms of the sequence. We have discoverd that so   Notice that the number 54 is the sum of the first term of the arithmetic series, 5, and the last term, 49. In other words, . This is the key observation we need to produce our formula.  In general, this sum occurs times and results in twice the series we want. Thus, and dividing both sides by 2 gives us the following formula for computing an arithmetic series.   Arithmetic Series  The sum of the first terms of an arithmetic sequence is  Find the sum of the first 15 odd integers.  The odd integers form an arithmetic sequence with first term and common difference 2. Thus, the general term of the sequence is , and we would like to find the series . We begin by finding the last term of the series, . Next we use the formula for with and :  Practice 2   Find the sum of the first 100 terms of the sequence  Answer:        15,050       Arlene starts a part-time job in a print shop at a salary of $800 per month. If she keeps up with the training program her salary will increase by $35 per month. How much will Arlene have earned at the end of the 18-month training program?  Arlene's monthly salary is an arithmetic sequence with and . Thus, the general tern of the sequence is , and we would like to find the series . We begin by finding the last term of the series, . Next we use the formula for with , and . Arlene's total earnings for the 18 months will be $19,755.  Practice 3   Arlene from the previous example decides to start a savings account. After her first paycheck, she deposits $50, and plans to increase her deposits by $5 per month. How much will she have in the savings account at the end of the 18-month training program?  $        $1665        Geometric Series  We can also find a formula for the sum of the first terms of a geometric sequence.  Sum of a Geometric Sequence  We'll compute the sum of the first 9 terms of the geometric sequence with and . Its general term is , or . Then   Instead of writing the terms in the opposite order, as we did for the arithmetic series, this time we will multiply each term of by the common ratio, 3. or  Next we subtract the first equation from the second equation. Most of the terms will cancel out in the subtraction.  Thus so  Notice that the second term of the numerator is (3 in this example) and the first term is or .  Although you might not guess it from this example, the denominator of the expression, 2, is equal to . In general, we can derive the following formula for computing a geometric series.  Geometric Series  The sum of the first terms of a geometric sequence is  QuickCheck 2   To find the series for a given sequence, we    Compute the last term of the sequence.    Find the average value of the terms.    Add the terms.    List the terms in the opposite order.          Add the terms.       Find the sum of the first five terms of the sequence .  The sequence is geometric with . We find by dividing by 5. Thus, the general term of the series is . We use the formula for a geometric series with , We substitute , and . Thus   Practice 4   Find the sum of the first ten terms of the geometric sequence          1593.74       Payam's starting salary as an engineer is $60,000 with a 5% annual raise for each of the next five years, depending on suitable progress. If Payam receives each salary increase, how much will he make over the next six years?  Payam's salary is multiplied each year by a factor of 1.05, so its values form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of . The general term of the sequence is . His total income over the six years will be the sum of the first six terms of the sequence. Thus, Payam will earn $408,114.77 over the next six years.  Practice 5   Show that the formula for a geometric series can also be written as   Check all the relevant statements.    The sum of the first terms of a geometric series is                  We can write as                  So the numerator from part (a) can be rewritten as                                          Section Summary  Vocabulary   Series  Arithmetic series  Geometric series    CONCEPTS   The sum of the terms of a sequence is called a series .

  "body": " Infinite Geometric Series  Summation Notation  There is a convenient notation for representing a series. For example, consider the sum of the first fifteen terms of the sequence To find the terms of the series we replace in the general term by the numbers 1 through 15. So, instead of writing out all the terms, we might express the sum as We use the Greek letter (called \"sigma\") to stand for \"the sum,\" and we show the first and last values of below and above the summation symbol , like this: Writing such an expression is sometimes called \"using sigma notation .\" The letter is called the index of summation ; it is like a variable because it represents numerical values.  Any letter can be used for the index of summation; and are other common choices. Of course, the letter used for the index of summation does not affect the sum.  Use sigma notation to represent the sum of the first 20 terms of the sequence  The general term of the sequence is , and the first term is , which we find by letting in the formula for the general term. Thus,  Practice 1   Use sigma notation to represent the sum of the first 20 terms of the sequence    where and                   QuickCheck 1   What does the notation mean?    List 8 terms of the sequence .    Add the numbers from 1 to 8 and take the reciprocal of the sum.    Add the reciprocals of the numbers from 1 to 8.    Add the first and eighth term of the sequence described.          Add the reciprocals of the numbers from 1 to 8.       The expanded form of a series written in sigma notation is obtained by writing out all the terms of the series. For example,  Notice that the series above has five terms, which is one more than the difference of the upper and lower limits of summation, .  Recall that the general term of an arithmetic series is a linear function of the index, and the general term of a geometric series is an exponential function. If we recognize a given series as one of these two types, we can use the formulas developed in the last section to evaluate the sum.  Compute the value of each series.     Because the general term is linear, this is an arithmetic series. By writing out the first few terms of the series, we can verify that the first term of the series is and the common difference is . We also need to know the last term of the series, so we substitute in the general term to find Thus,  The general term of this series is exponential, so the series is geometric. By writing out a few terms of the series, we confirm that the first term of the series is and the common ratio is . The series has 10 terms, from to , so . Finally, we substitute these values into the formula for geometric series to obtain  Practice 2   Compute the value of each series.                      3925    111,111,110         If the series is not arithmetic or geometric, we don't have a formula for the sum, so we must compute the sum directly.  Compute the value of each series.     Because the general term, , is neither linear nor exponential, we know that the series is not arithmetic or geometric. However, we can expand the series and evaluate it directly.  The general term is the number 5. Because the index runs from 1 to 800, we are adding 800 terms, each of which is 5. Thus  Practice 3   Compute the value of each series.                      7            QuickCheck 2   Which of these series is neither arithmetic nor geometric?                      is neither arithmetic nor geometric. (The first series is arithmetic; the second and fourth series are both geometric.        Infinite Series  A series with infinitely many terms is called an infinite series . Is it possible to add infinitely many terms and arrive at a finite sum? In some cases, if the terms added are small enough, the answer is yes.  Consider the infinite geometric series The  partial sum of the series is the sum of its first terms, and is denoted by . Thus, Notice that for each partial sum, the new term added gets smaller and smaller: , , , and so on. You can also see that as increases and we add more and more terms of the series, the partial sums are getting closer to 1. In fact, as becomes very large, gets very close to 1. It seems reasonable that the sum of all the terms of the series is 1.  Will the partial sums ever be greater than 1? No, because each new term added is half the difference between and 1.  We can make this conjecture more plausible by examining the formula for the partial sum of a geometric series, Look at the second term of the numerator, . This term is the only part of the formula that depends on . What happens to as increases? Consider two examples:   If , then and so on, with becoming smaller and smaller for larger values of . Each time we multiply by another factor of , the product gets smaller, because .  On the other hand, if , multiplying by makes the product larger. If for example, then and so on. In this case the powers of are increasing.   In general, we have the following result.   If , then gets closer to zero as increases.  If , then does not approach a finite number as increases.  Now let's return to the formula for and write it in the form where we have factored from the numerator. There are two cases to consider. If , then approaches 0, and the factor gets closer and closer to 1 as grows larger. Consequently, if we compute for larger and larger values of , the sum approaches the value This analysis motivates us to define the sum of an infinite geometric series as follows.  Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series  The sum of an infinite geometric series is  In the second case, if , as in the infinite series where , the terms become larger as increases, and the sum of the series is not a finite number. In this case the series does not have a sum.  QuickCheck 3   Under what circumstances does the series have a finite sum?    If    If    If    If          If       Make a table showing the first five partial sums of each series. Then use the formula to find the sum, if it exists.     First, we evaluate the general term for and compute the partial sums. For example, and so on. The results, rounded to hundredths, are shown in the table.                  This is an infinite geometric series with and . The series has a sum because . Thus,  We evaluate the general term for and compute the partial sums. For example, and so on. The results, rounded to hundredths, are shown in the table.                  This is a geometric series with and . The infinite series does not have a sum because .  Practice 4   Find the sum, if it exists. If the series does not have a sum, enter no sum .                      No sum    59          Repeating Decimals  An interesting application of geometric series involves repeating decimals. Recall that the decimal representation of a rational number either terminates, as does or repeats a pattern of digits. For example, you probably recognize as the decimal representation of . It is easy to find the decimal form of a fraction: we just divide the denominator into the numerator. Is there a way to find the fractional form of a repeating decimal?  Consider the repeating decimal We can write this number as an infinite geometric series: The first term of this series is , or , and its common ratio is , or . Because , the series has a sum given by Thus, the decimal number is equal to the fraction .  Find a common fraction equivalent to .  The decimal can be written as . We will find a fraction equivalent to the repeating decimal and add that to , or . We write as a series: This is an infinite geometric series with first term and common ratio .

It is possible to add infinitely many terms and arrive at a finite sum if the terms are small enough.  The sum of an infinite geometric series is  If in an infinite geometric series, the series does not have a sum.    STUDY QUESTIONS   Explain how to use sigma notation to define a series.  What is an infinite series?  What is a partial sum of an infinite series?  State a formula for evaluating an infinite geometric series. Under what conditions is the formula valid?  A repeating decimal can be rewritten as what kind of series?    SKILLS Practice each skill in the Homework Problems listed.  Express sigma notation in expanded form: #1-8  Write a series in sigma notation: #12-20  Identify a series as arithmetic, geometric, or neither and evaluate: #21-40  Evaluate an infinite geometric series: #41-48, #57-60  Write a repeating decimal as a common fraction: #49-56     Homework 9.4   For Problems 1 8, write the sum in expanded form.            For Problems 9 20, write the series using sigma notation.                For Problems 21 40, identify the series as arithmetic, geometric or neither, then evaluate it.  Neither; 97    Neither;    Neither; 100    Geometric;    Atithmetic;    Neither; 441    Arithemetic; 1364    Arithmetic;    Geometric;    Geometric;     For Problems 41 48,  Make a table of values showing the first five partial sums of the series.  Evaluate the series algebraically.            For Problems 49 56, find a fraction equivalent to the repeating decimal.           The arc length through which the bob of a pendulum moves is nine-tenths of its preceding arc length. Approximately how far will the bob move before coming to rest if the first arc length is inches? 120 in   A force is applied to a particle moving in a straight line in such a fashion that each second it moves only one-half of the distance it moved the preceding second. If the particle moves centimeters the first second, approximately how far will it move before coming to rest?  A ball returns two-thirds of its preceding height on each bounce. If the ball is dropped from a height of feet, approximately what is the total distance the ball travels before coming to rest? (Hint: Compute separately the total distance the ball falls from the total distance it moves upwards.) 30 ft   If a ball is dropped from a height of feet and returns three-fifths of its preceding height on each bounce, approximately what is the total distance the ball travels before coming to rest? (See the Hint for Problem 59.)   "

  "body": " The Binomial Expansion  Earlier we studied products of polynomials, and in particular we found expanded forms for powers of binomials such as and . The amount of work involved in expanding such powers increases as the exponent gets larger. In this section we will learn how to raise a binomial to any positive integer power, without having to perform the polynomial products.  Powers of Binomials  In this investigation we will look for patterns in the expansion of . We begin by computing several such powers.  Expand each power and fill in the blanks. Arrange the terms in each expansion in descending powers of .       Hint: Start by writing and use your answer to #3.   Hint: Start by writing and use your answer to #4.   Do you see a relationship between the exponent and the number of terms in the expansion of ? (Notice that for we have , which has one term.) Fill in the table below.     Number of terms  in                     First observation: In general, the expansion of has terms.  Next we'll consider the exponents on and in each term of the expansions. Refer to your expanded powers in parts 1-5, and fill in the next table.     First term of  Last term of  Sum of exponents on and in each term                                  Second observation: In any term of the expansion of , the sum of the exponents on and on is  In fact, we can be more specific in describing the exponents in the expansions. We will use to label the terms in the expansion of , starting with . For example, for we label the terms as follows: . We can make a table showing the exponents on and in each term of :  Case :        Exponent on      Exponent on      Complete the tables shown below for the cases and .

(Fill in the correct powers in terms of and for and .)   In the next investigation we will look for patterns in the coefficients of the terms of the expansions.   Powers of Other Binomials  We can use what we learned from the Investigation to raise other binomials to powers.  Expand each power of a binomial.     We know from the Investigation that We replace with and with 1 to get   This time we take the expansion from the Investigation and let and .    Practice 1   Expand               The Binomial Coefficient  Now we continue our study of powers of binomials. What should the expansion of look like? From the Iinvestigation we know that it should have 7 terms, with the exponents on decreasing from 6 down to 0, and the exponents on increasing from 0 up to 6.  Thus, the expansion should have the form But what about the numerical coefficients of the terms? We will use the notation for the coefficient of the term in the expansion of . For example, in the expansion of above,   the coefficient of is denoted by ,  the coefficient of is ,  the coefficient of is ,  and so on. Note that the 6 in front of the indicates that , and the number following corresponds to the exponent on . The symbol is called the binomial coefficient .  The Binomial Coefficient  The binomial coefficient  is the coefficient of the term containing in the expansion of .  Use your expansions from the Investigation to evaluate the following binomial coefficients.     is the coefficient of the term containing in the expansion of . Referring to Step 5 in the Investigation, we see that the coefficient of the term is 4. Thus, .  is the coefficient of the term containing in the expansion of . Referring to Step 6 in the Investigation, we see that the coefficient of the term is 10. Thus, .  Practice 2   Evaluate the binomial coefficients.                      5    1         Pascal's Triangle  To get a clearer picture of the binomial coefficients, consider again the expansions of you calculated in the last Investigation, but this time look only at the numerical coefficients of each term:                             This triangular array of numbers is known as Pascal's triangle . It has many interesting and surprising properties that have been extensively studied. We might first make the following observations.  Each row of Pascal's triangle begins with the number and ends with the number .  The second number and the next-to-last number in the row are .  There is an interesting pattern for the rest of the numbers in each row. Pick any number in the row , and look at the two closest numbers in the previous row. (For example, if you picked 6, the two closest numbers in the previous row are 3 and 3.) Do you see a relationship between the numbers? Try the same thing with several numbers in row to test your theory.  Starting with the row , any number in the triangle (except the first and last 1's in each row) can be found by .  Using your answer to question #3, continue Pascal's triangle to include the row for .  The numbers in Pascal's triangle are the binomial coefficients we have been looking for. Specifically, the number in the position (starting with ) of the row of the triangle is . Thus, we can use the numbers in Pascal's triangle to expand .   Use Pascal's triangle to find the binomial coefficient .  Expand: .  Expand:  . (Hint: Use your answer to #6, replacing by and by .)  Continue Pascal's triangle to include the row for .    Using Pascal's Triangle  We can now write the expanded form of any binomial power without having to perform the multiplication.    Find the expanded form of without performing the multiplication.    Start by writing down the expansion of . Next, fill in the blanks with the binomial coefficients from Pascal's triangle. Finally, replace by and replace by , then simplify to find     Practice 3   Expand               Factorial Notation  Finding binomial coefficients from Pascal's triangle is tedious for large values of . It would be convenient to have a formula for calculating the coefficients directly. For this formula we need a new symbol, (read \" factorial\" ), which is defined as follows:  Factorial  If is a positive integer,  For example,  The factorial symbol applies only to the variable or number it follows; for example, is not equal to .  Write each expression in expanded form and simplify.  for  for     Practice 4   Evalute        24       Write in factored form, showing the first three factors and the last three factors.

Zero Factorial   Note that both and are equal to .   The Binomial Coefficient in Factorial Notation  Earlier we introduced the notation for the numerical coefficients in the expansion of . These binomial coefficients, which are given by Pascal's triangle, can also be expressed using factorial notation as follows.  Binomial Coefficients  For and ,  Evaluate each binomial coefficient.        Practice 7   Evaluate the binomial coefficient               You can check that the formula works for when we use . You should find that so the formula correctly gives us the coefficient of in the expansion of .  We now have two methods for computing the binomial coefficient : Pascal's triangle and our formula using factorials. When is small, especially if all the coefficients of the binomial expansion are needed, Pascal's triangle is often the easier choice. But when is large or if only one coefficient is required, the factorial formula for is probably quicker than Pascal's triangle.  Find the coefficient of in the expansion of .  We are simply replacing with and with in the expansion of , so the term containing has and , and its coefficient is . The coefficient of is .  Exercise 7   Find the coefficient of in the expansion of  Answer:               The Binomial Theorem  Consider the expansion of written with the notation for the coefficients.  Check that each term can be written in the form for to . This means that we can use sigma notation to write the sum of the terms in the expansion. Notice that the sigma notation indicates terms for to , so there are 7 terms in the expansion, as there should be. Also note that the sum of the exponents on and is .  The equation above is a special case of the binomial theorem binomial theorem , which uses everything we have learned to write the expanded form of a power of a binomial in the most compact form possible.

The output values are called the terms of the sequence.  A formula in terms of for the term of a sequence is called the general term of the sequence.  A sequence is defined recursively if each term of the sequence is defined in terms of its predecessors.  A sequence in which each term can be obtained from the previous term by adding a fixed amount is called an arithmetic sequence.  The fixed amount between two successive terms of an arithmetic sequence is called the common difference.  An arithmetic sequence defines a linear function of .  The term of an arithmetic sequence is .  A sequence in which each term can be obtained from the previous term by multiplying by a fixed amount is called a geometric sequence.  The ratio of two successive terms of a geometric sequence is called the common ratio.  A geometric sequence defines an exponential function of .  The term of a geometric sequence is .  The sum of the terms of a sequence is called a series.  The sum of the first terms of an arithmetic sequence is  The sum of the first terms of a geometric sequence is  We can use sigma notation to denote a series.  It is possible to add infinitely many terms and arrive at a finite sum if the terms are small enough.  The sum of an infinite geometric series is  If in an infinite geometric series, the series does not have a sum.

  "body": "Numbers and Operations  Order of Operations  Numerical calculations often involve more than one operation. So that everyone agrees on how such expressions should be evaluated, we follow the order of operations .  Order of Operations   Simplify any expressions within grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, square root bars, or fraction bars). Start with the innermost grouping symbols and work outward.  Evaluate all powers and roots.  Perform multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.  Perform additions and subtractions in order from left to right.    Parentheses and Fraction Bars  We can use parentheses to override the multiplication-first rule. Compare the two expressions below.  In the first expression, we perform the multiplication first, but in the second expression we perform the addition first, because it is enclosed in parentheses.  The location (or absence) of parentheses can drastically alter the meaning of an expression. In the following example, note how the location of the parentheses changes the value of the expression.        In the expression , which appears in , the exponent applies only to , not to . Thus, .  The order of operations mentions other grouping devices besides parentheses: fraction bars and square root bars. Notice how the placement of the fraction bar affects the expressions in the next example.         Radicals  You are already familiar with square roots. Every nonnegative number has two square roots, defined as follows: There are several other kinds of roots, one of which is called the cube root cube root , denoted by . We define the cube root as follows.  Cube Roots cube root  In symbols, we write   Although we cannot take the square root of a negative number , we can take the cube root of any real number. For example, and  In the order of operations, simplifying radicals and powers comes after parentheses but before products and quotients.  Simplify each expression.             Scientific Notation  Scientists and engineers regularly encounter very large numbers such as (the mass of the Earth in kilograms) and very small numbers such as (the mass of a hydrogen atom in grams). These numbers can be written in a more compact and useful form by using powers of .  In our base number system, multiplying a number by a positive power of has the effect of moving the decimal place places to the right, where is the exponent in the power of . For example, Multiplying by a power of with a negative exponent moves the decimal place to the left. For example,  Using this property, we can write any number as the product of a number between and (including ) and a power of . For example, the mass of the Earth and the mass of a hydrogen atom can be expressed as respectively. A number written in this form is said to be expressed in scientific notation scientific notation .  To Write a Number in Scientific Notation:   Locate the decimal point so that there is exactly one nonzero digit to its left.  Count the number of places you moved the decimal point: This determines the power of .  If the original number is greater than , the exponent is positive.  If the original number is less than , the exponent is negative.    Write each number in scientific notation.     The average American eats kilograms of meat per year. It takes about kilograms of grain to produce kilogram of meat, and advanced farming techniques can produce about kilograms of grain on each hectare of arable land. (The hectare is square meters, or just under acres.) Now, the total land area of the Earth is about billion hectares, but only about of that land is arable. Is it possible for each of the billion people on Earth to eat as much meat as Americans do?  First we will compute the amount of meat necessary to feed every person on Earth kilograms per year. In 2018 there are people on Earth. Next we will compute the amount of grain needed to produce that much meat. Next we will see how many hectares of land are needed to produce that much grain. Finally, we will compute the amount of arable land available for grain production. Thus, even if we use every hectare of arable land to produce grain for livestock, we will not have enough to provide every person on Earth with kilograms of meat per year.

In 2018, the public debt of the United States was over $20,620,000,000,000.  Express this number in scientific notation.  If the population of the United States in 2018 was 327,112,000, what was the per capita debt (the debt per person) in 2018?     $63,036.51    A light-year is the number of miles traveled by light in 1 year (365 days). The speed of light is approximately 186,000 miles per second.  Compute the number of miles in 1 light-year, and express your answer in scientific notation.  The star nearest to the Sun is Proxima Centauri, at a distance of 4.3 light-hears. How long would it take Pioneer 10 (the first space vehicle to achieve escape velocity from the solar system), traveling at 32,114 miles per hour, to reach Proxima Centauri?     The diameter of the galactic disk is about kilometers, and our Sun lies about halfway from the center of the galaxy to the edge of the disk. The Sun orbits the galactic center once in 240 million years.  What is the speed of the Sun in its orbit, in kilometers per year?  What is its speed in meters per second?    km per year  250,000 meters per second    Lake Superior has an area of 31,700 square miles and an average depth of 483 feet.  Find the approximate volume of Lake Superior in cubic feet.  If 1 cubic foot of water is equivalent to 7.48 gallons, how many gallons of water are in Lake Superior?     The average distance from the Earth to the Sun is meters. The distance from the Sun to Proxima Centauri, the next closest star, is meters. The most distant star visible to the unaided eye are 2000 times as far away as Proxima Centauri.  How many times farther is Proxima Centauri from the Sun than the Sun is from Earth?  How far from the Sun are the most distant visible stars?    250,000 times  meters    The radius of the Earth is meters, and the radius of the Sun is meters. The radii of the other stars range from 1% of the solar radius to 1000 times the solar radius.  What fraction of the solar radius is the Earth's radius?  What is the range of stellar radii, in meters?      "

  "body": "Linear Equations and Inequalities  An equation is just a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal. Equations relating two variables are particularly useful. If we know the value of one of the variables, we can find the corresponding value of the other variable by solving the equation.  The equation gives Loren's wages, , in terms of the number of hours she works, . How many hours does Loren need to work next week if she wants to earn $ ?  We know that , and we would like to know the value of . We substitute the value for into our equation and then solve for . Loren must work hours in order to earn $ . In reality, Loren will probably have to work for hours, because most employers do not pay for portions of an hour's work. Thus, Loren needs to work for hours.   To solve an equation we can generate simpler equations that have the same solutions. Equations that have identical solutions are called equivalent equations equivalent equations . For example, and are equivalent equations because the solution of each equation is . Often we can find simpler equivalent equations by undoing in reverse order the operations performed on the variable.  Solving Linear Equations  Linear , or first-degree, equations can be written so that every term is either a constant or a constant times the variable. The equations above are examples of linear equations. Recall the following rules for solving linear equations.  To Generate Equivalent Equations   We can add or subtract the same number on both sides of an equation.  We can multiply or divide both sides of an equation by the same number (except zero).   Applying either of these rules produces a new equation equivalent to the old one and thus preserves the solution.  We use the rules to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.  Solve the equation .  We first collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation, and the constant terms on the other side. The solution is . (You can check the solution by substituting into the original equation to show that a true statement results.)  The following steps should enable you to solve any linear equation. Of course, you may not need all the steps for a particular equation.  To Solve a Linear Equation:   Simplify each side of the equation separately.  Apply the distributive law to remove parentheses.  Collect like terms.   By adding or subtracting appropriate terms on both sides of the equation, get all the variable terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other.  Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable.   Solve .  We begin by simplifying each side of the equation. Next, we collect all the variable terms on the left side of the equation, and all the constant terms on the right side. Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable. The solution is .   Formulas  A formula formula is an equation that relates several variables. For example, the equation gives the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of its length and width.  Suppose we have some wire fence to enclose an exercise area for rabbits, and we would like to see what dimensions are possible for different rectangles with that perimeter. In this case, it would be more useful to have a formula for the length of the rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width. We can find such a formula by solving the perimeter formula for in terms of and . The result is a new formula that gives the length of a rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width.  The formula relates the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, , to the temperature in degrees Celsius, . Solve the formula for in terms of .  We begin by isolating the term that contains . We can also write the formula for in terms of as .   Solve for in terms of .  We isolate on one side of the equation.    Linear Inequalities  The symbol is called an inequality symbol inequality symbol , and the statement is called an inequality inequality . There are four inequality symbols:  Inequalities that include the symbols or are called strict inequalities strict inequalities ; those that include or are called nonstrict nonstrict .  If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality must be reversed. For example, if we multiply both sides of the inequality by , we get Because of this property, the rules for solving linear equations must be revised slightly for solving linear inequalities.  To Solve a Linear Inequality:   We may add or subtract the same number to both sides of an inequality without changing its solutions.  We may multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a positive number without changing its solutions.  If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality symbol .   Solve the inequality .  Use the rules above to isolate on one side of the inequality. Notice that we reversed the direction of the inequality when we divided by . Any number less than or equal to is a solution of the inequality.  A compound inequality compound inequality involves two inequality symbols.  Solve .  We isolate by performing the same operations on all three sides of the inequality. The solutions are all numbers between and , inclusive.   Interval Notation  The solutions of the inequality in form an interval. An interval interval is a set that consists of all the real numbers between two numbers and .  The set includes its endpoints and , so we call it a closed interval closed interval , and we denote it by . Its graph is shown in figure (a). The square brackets tell us that the endpoints are included in the interval. An interval that does not include its endpoints, such as , is called an open interval open interval , and we denote it with round brackets, . Its graph is shown in figure (b).  closed interval and open interva  Do not confuse the open interval with the point ! The notation is the same, so you must decide from the context whether an interval or a point is being discussed.  We can also discuss infinite intervals infinite intervals , such as and , shown in the figure below. We denote the interval by , and the interval by . The symbol , for infinity, does not represent a specific real number; it indicates that the interval continues forever along the real line.  infinite intervals    Finally, we can combine two or more intervals into a larger set. For example, the set consisting of or , shown below, is the union union of two intervals and is denoted by .  number line with two disjoint infinite intervals  Many solutions of inequalities are intervals or unions of intervals.  Write each of the solution sets with interval notation and graph the solution set on a number line.        . This is called a half-open half-open or half-closed half-closed interval.  half-open interval   . We always use round brackets next to the symbol because is not a specific number and is not included in the set.  half-closed infinite interval   .

  "title": "Algebraic Expressions and Problem Solving",
  "body": "Algebraic Expressions and Problem Solving  You are familiar with the use of letters, or variables , to stand for unknown numbers in equations or formulas. Variables are also used to represent numerical quantities that change over time or in different situations. For example, might stand for the atmospheric pressure at different heights above the Earth's surface. Or might represent the number of people infected with cholera days after the start of an epidemic.  An algebraic expression algebraic expression is any meaningful combination of numbers, variables, and symbols of operation. Algebraic expressions are used to express relationships between variable quantities.  Loren makes $ an hour working at the campus bookstore.  Choose a variable for the number of hours Loren works per week.  Write an algebraic expression for the amount of Loren's weekly earnings.     Let stand for the number of hours Loren works per week.  The amount Loren earns is given by or . Loren's weekly earnings can be expressed as .   The algebraic expression represents the amount of money Loren earns in terms of the number of hours she works. If we substitute a specific value for the variable in an expression, we find a numerical value for the expression. This is called evaluating evaluating the expression.  If Loren from works for hours in the bookstore this week, how much will she earn?  Evaluate the expression for . Loren will make $ .  April sells environmentally friendly cleaning products. Her income consists of $ per week plus a commission of of her sales.  Choose variables to represent the unknown quantities and write an algebraic expression for April's weekly income in terms of her sales.  Find April's income for a week in which she sells $ worth of cleaning products.    Let represent April's total income for the week, and let represent the total amount of her sales. We translate the information from the problem into mathematical language as follows: Thus, .  We want to evaluate our expression from part (a) with . We substitute for to find Following the order of operations, we perform the multiplication before the addition. Thus, we begin by computing . April's income for the week is $ .   Calculator Tip  On a scientific or a graphing calculator, we can enter the expression from just as it is written:        ENTER The calculator will perform the operations in the correct order—multiplication first.   Economy Parcel Service charges $ per pound to deliver a package from Pasadena to Cedar Rapids. Andrew wants to mail a painting that weighs pounds, plus whatever packing material he uses.  Choose variables to represent the unknown quantities and write an expression for the cost of shipping Andrew's painting.  Find the shipping cost if Andrew uses pounds of packing material.    Let stand for the shipping cost and let stand for the weight of the packing material. Andrew must find the total weight of his package first, then multiply by the shipping charge.  The total weight of the package is pounds. We use parentheses around this expression to show that it should be computed first, and the sum should be multiplied by the shipping charge of $ per pound. Thus,  Evaluate the formula from part (a) with . The cost of shipping the painting is $ .   Calculator Tip  On a calculator, we enter the expression for in the order it appears, including the parentheses. (Experiment to see whether your calculator requires you to enter the symbol after 2.80.) The keying sequence  ENTER gives the correct result, .  If we omit the parentheses, the calculator will perform the multiplication before the addition. Thus, the keying sequence gives an incorrect result for . (The sequence does not work either!)   Problem Solving  Problem solving often involves translating a real-life problem into a computer programming language, or, in our case, into algebraic expressions. We can then use algebra to solve the mathematical problem and interpret the solution in the context of the original problem. Here are some guidelines for problem solving with algebraic equations.  Guidelines for Problem Solving  Identify the unknown quantity and assign a variable to represent it.  Find some quantity that can be expressed in two different ways and write an equation.  Solve the equation.  Interpret your solution to answer the question in the problem.   In step 1, begin by writing an English phrase to describe the quantity you are looking for. Be as specific as possible—if you are going to write an equation about this quantity, you must understand its properties! Remember that your variable must represent a numerical quantity. For example, can represent the speed of a train, but not just “the train.”  Writing an equation is the hardest part of the problem. Note that the quantity mentioned in step 2 will probably not be the same unknown quantity you are looking for, but the algebraic expressions you write will involve your variable. For example, if your variable represents the speed of a train, your equation might be about the distance the train traveled.   Supply and Demand  The law of supply and demand is fundamental in economics. If you increase the price of a product, the supply increases because its manufacturers are willing to provide more of the product, but the demand decreases because consumers are not willing to buy as much at a higher price. The price at which the demand for a product equals the supply is called the equilibrium price equilibrium price .  The Coffee Connection finds that when it charges dollars for a pound of coffee, it can sell pounds per month. On the other hand, at a price of dollars a pound, International Food and Beverage will supply the Connection with pounds of coffee per month. What price should the Coffee Connection charge for a pound of coffee so that its monthly inventory will sell out?   We are looking for the equilibrium price, .  The Coffee Connection would like the demand for its coffee to equal its supply. We equate the expressions for supply and for demand to obtain the equation  Solve the equation. To get all terms containing the variable, , on one side of the equation, we add to both sides and subtract from both sides to obtain  The Coffee Connection should charge $ per pound for its coffee.    Percent Problems  Recall the basic formula for computing percents.  Percent Formula  the P art (or percent) = the percentage r ate the W hole Amount  A percent increase percent increase or percent decrease percent decrease is calculated as a fraction of the original amount. For example, suppose you make $ an hour now, but next month you are expecting a raise. Your new salary should be  The price of housing in urban areas increased over the past year. If a certain house costs $ today, what was its price last year?   Let represent the cost of the house last year.  Express the current price of the house in two different ways. During the past year, the price of the house increased by , or . Its current price is thus This expression is equal to the value given for current price of the house:  To solve this equation, we divide both sides by to find  To the nearest cent, the cost of the house last year was $ .   In , it would be incorrect to calculate last year's price by subtracting of $ from $ to get $ . (Do you see why?)   Weighted Averages  We find the average average , or mean mean , of a set of values by adding up the values and dividing the sum by the number of values. Thus, the average, , of the numbers is given by In a weighted average weighted average , the numbers being averaged occur with different frequencies or are weighted differently in their contribution to the average value. For instance, suppose a biology class of 12 students takes a 10-point quiz. Of the 12 students, 2 receive 10s, three receive 9s, 5 receive 8s, and 2 receive scores of 6. The average score earned on the quiz is then The numbers in color are called the weights—in this example they represent the number of times each score was counted. Note that , the total number of scores, is equal to the sum of the weights:  Kwan's grade in his accounting class will be computed as follows: Tests count for of the grade, homework counts for , and the final exam counts for . If Kwan has an average of on tests and on homework, what score does he need on the final exam to earn a grade of ?   Let represent the final exam score Kwan needs.  Kwan's grade is the weighted average of his test, homework, and final exam scores. (The sum of the weights is 1.00, or 100% of Kwan’s grade.) Multiply both sides of the equation by to get  Solve the equation. Simplify the left side first.  Kwan needs a score of on the final exam to earn a grade of .   In step 2 of , we rewrote the formula for a weighted average in a simpler form.  Weighted Average weighted average  The sum of the weighted values equals the sum of the weights times the average value. In symbols, where is the sum of the weights.  This form is particularly useful for solving problems involving mixtures.  The vet advised Delbert to feed his dog Rollo with kibble that is no more than fat. Rollo likes JuicyBits, which are fat. LeanMeal is more expensive, but it is only fat. How much LeanMeal should Delbert mix with pounds of JuicyBits to make amixture that is fat?   Let represent the number of pounds of LeanMeal needed.  In this problem, we want the weighted average of the fat contents in the two kibbles to be . The weights are the number of pounds of each kibble we use. It is often useful to summarize the given information in a table.         fat  Total pounds  Pounds of fat   Juicy Bits      LeanMeal      Mixture     The amount of fat in the mixture must come from adding the amounts of fat in the two ingredients. This gives us an equation, This equation is an example of the formula for weighted averages.  Simplify each side of the equation, using the distributive law on the right side, then solve.  Delbert should mix pounds of LeanMeal with pounds of JuicyBits to make a mixture that is fat.     Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

  "body": "Graphs and Equations  Graphs are useful tools for studying mathematical relationships. A graph provides an overview of a quantity of data, and it helps us identify trends or unexpected occurrences. Interpreting the graph can help us answer questions about the data.  For example, here are some data showing the atmospheric pressure at different altitudes. Altitude is given in feet, and atmospheric pressure is given in inches of mercury.            Altitude (ft)          Pressure (in. Hg)          We observe a generally decreasing trend in pressure as the altitude increases, but it is difficult to say anything more precise about this relationship. A clearer picture emerges if we plot the data. To do this, we use two perpendicular number lines called axes. We use the horizontal axis for the values of the first variable, altitude, and the vertical axis for the values of the second variable, pressure.  The entries in the table are called ordered pairs , in which the first component is the altitude and the second component is the atmospheric pressure measured at that altitude. For example, the first two entries can be represented by and . We plot the points whose coordinates are given by the ordered pairs, as shown in the figure on the left.  graphs of pressure vs altitude  We can connect the data points with a smooth curve as shown in the figure on the right. In doing this, we are assuming that one variable changes smoothly with respect to the other, and in fact this is true for many physical situations. Thus, a smooth curve will thus serve as a good model.  Reading a Graph  Once we have constructed a graph, we can use it to estimate values of the variables between the known data points.  From the graph of atmospheric pressure, estimate the following:  The atmospheric pressure measured at an altitude of feet  The altitude at which the pressure is inches of mercury    The point with first coordinate on the graph at right has second coordinate approximately . We estimate the pressure at feet to be inches of mercury.  graph of pressure vs altitude with two points highlighted   The point on the graph with second coordinate has first coordinate approximately , so an atmospheric pressure of inches of mercury occurs at about feet.   We can also use the graph to obtain information about the relationship between altitude and pressure that would be difficult to see from the data alone.   For what altitudes is the pressure less than inches of mercury?  How much does the pressure decrease as the altitude increases from feet to feet?  For which -foot increase in altitude does the pressure change most rapidly?    From the graph we see that the pressure has dropped to inches of mercury at about feet, and that it continues to decrease as the altitude increases. Therefore, the pressure is less than inches of mercury for altitudes greater than feet.  The pressure at feet is approximately inches of mercury, and at feet it is inches. This represents a decrease in pressure of , or , inches of mercury.  By studying the graph we see that the pressure decreases most rapidly at low altitudes, so we conclude that the greatest drop in pressure occurs between and feet.    Graphs of Equations  In , we used a graph to illustrate data given in a table. Graphs can also help us analyze models given by equations. Let's first review some facts about solutions of equations in two variables.  An equation in two variables, such as y = 2x + 3, is said to be satisfied if the variables are replaced by a pair of numbers that make the statement true. The pair of numbers is called a solution solution of the equation and is usually written as an ordered pair . (The first number in the pair is the value of and the second number is the value of .)  To find a solution of a given equation, we can assign a number to one of the variables and then solve for the second variable.  Find solutions to the equation .  We choose some values for , say, , , and . Substitute these -values into the equation to find a corresponding -value for each. Thus, the ordered pairs , , and are three solutions of . We can also substitute values for . For example, if we let , we have Solving this equation for , we find , or . This means that the ordered pair is another solution of the equation .  An equation in two variables may have infinitely many solutions, so we cannot list them all. However, we can display the solutions on a graph. For this we use a Cartesian Cartesian (or rectangular rectangular ) coordinate system coordinate system , as shown below left.   coordinate plane  line in the coordinate plane  The graph of an equation graph of an equation is a picture of its solutions. A point is included in the graph if its coordinates satisfy the equation, and if the coordinates do not satisfy the equation, the point is not part of the graph. A graph of is shown above right.  This graph does not display all the solutions of the equation, but it shows important features such as the intercepts on the - and -axes. Because there is a solution corresponding to every real number , the graph extends infinitely in either direction, as indicated by the arrows.  Use the graph of shown at right to decide whether the given ordered pairs are solutions of the equation. Verify your answers algebraically.     parabola in the coordinate plane    Because the point does lie on the graph, the ordered pair is a solution of . We can verify this by substituting for and for :  Because the point does not lie on the graph, the ordered pair is not a solution of . We substitute for and for to verify this.

  "title": "Linear Systems in Two Variables",
  "body": "Linear Systems in Two Variables linear system  A  system of equations is a set of equations in the same variables. A solution solution of a system is an ordered pair that makes each equation in the system true. In this section, we review two algebraic methods for solving linear systems: substitution and elimination.  Solving Systems by Substitution  The basic strategy for the substitution substitution method can be described as follows.  Steps for Solving a System by Substitution   Solve one of the equations for one of the variables in terms of the other.  Substitute this expression into the second equation; doing so yields an equation in one variable.  Solve the new equation.  Use the result of step 1 to find the other variable.   Staci stocks two kinds of sleeping bags in her sporting goods store, a standard model and a down-filled model for colder temperatures. From past experience, she estimates that she will sell twice as many of the standard variety as of the down filled. She has room to stock 60 sleeping bags at a time. How many of each variety should Staci order?     Write two equations about the variables. Staci needs twice as many standard model as down filled, so Also, the total number of sleeping bags is 60, so  We will solve this system using substitution. Notice that Equation (1) is already solved for in terms of : . Substitute for in Equation (2) to obtain Solving for , we find . Finally, substitute this value into Equation (1) to find The solution to the system is .  Staci should order standard sleeping bags and down-filled bags.    Solving Systems by Elimination  The method of substitution is convenient if one of the variables in the system has a coefficient of or , because it is easy to solve for that variable. If none of the coefficients is or , then a second method, called elimination elimination , is usually more efficient.  The method of elimination is based on the following properties of linear equations.  Properties of Linear Systems   Multiplying a linear equation by a (nonzero) constant does not change its solutions. That is, any solution of the equation is also a solution of the equation  Adding (or subtracting) two linear equations does not change their common solutions. That is, any solution of the system is also a solution of the equation   Solve the system by the method of elimination.  We first decide which variable to eliminate, or . We can choose whichever looks easiest. In this problem, we choose to eliminate .  We next look for the smallest number that both coefficients, and , divide into evenly. This number is . We want the coefficients of to become and , so we will multiply Equation (1) by and Equation (2) by to obtain Now we add the corresponding terms of (1a) and (2a). The -terms are eliminated, yielding an equation in one variable. We solve this equation for to find . We can substitute this value of into any of our equations involving both and . If we choose Equation (1), then and solving this equation yields . The ordered pair is a solution to the system. You should verify that these values satisfy both original equations.  We summarize the strategy for solving a linear system by elimination.  Steps for Solving a Linear System by Elimination   Choose one of the variables to eliminate. Multiply each equation by a suitable factor so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.  Add the two new equations termwise.  Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.  Substitute the value found in step 3 into either of the original equations and solve for the other variable.   In , we added times the first equation to times the second equation. The result from adding a constant multiple of one equation to a constant multiple of another equation is called a linear combination linear combination of the two equations. The method of elimination is also called the method of linear combinations linear combination .  If either equation in a system has fractional coefficients, it is helpful to clear the fractions before applying the method of linear combinations.  Solve the system by linear combinations.  Multiply each side of Equation (1) by and each side of Equation (2) by to clear the fractions: To eliminate the variable , multiply Equation (2a) by and add the result to Equation (1a) to get Substitute for in one of the original equations and solve for . We use Equation (2). Verify that and satisfy both Equations (1) and (2). The solution to the system is the ordered pair .

  "body": "Laws of Exponents laws of exponents  In this section, we review the rules for performing operations on powers.  Product of Powers  Consider a product of two powers with the same base. because occurs as a factor five times. The number of 's in the product is the of the number of 's in each factor.  First Law of Exponents: Product of Powers  To multiply two powers with the same base, add the exponents and leave the base unchanged.   figure showing powers   Here are some mistakes to avoid.   Note that we do not multiply the exponents when simplifying a product. For example, You can check this with your calculator by choosing a value for , for instance, :  In order to apply the first law of exponents, the bases must be the same. For example, (Check this on your calculator.)  We do not multiply the bases when simplifying a product. In a, note that  Although we can simplify the product as , we cannot simplify the sum , because and are not like terms.   Multiply .  Rearrange the factors to group the numerical coefficients and the powers of each base. Apply the first law of exponents.   Quotients of Powers  To reduce a fraction, we divide both numerator and denominator by any common factors. We can obtain the same result more quickly by subtracting the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator.  What if the larger power occurs in the denominator of the fraction? In this case, we subtract the exponent of the numerator from the exponent of the denominator. These examples suggest the following law.  Second Law of Exponents: Quotient of Powers  To divide two powers with the same base, subtract the smaller exponent from the larger one, keeping the same base.  If the larger exponent occurs in the numerator, put the power in the numerator.  If the larger exponent occurs in the denominator, put the power in the denominator.       Divide  Consider the numerical coefficients and the powers of each variable separately. Use the second law of exponents to simplify each quotient of powers.   Power of a Power  Consider the expression , the third power of . We can obtain the same result by multiplying the exponents together.  Third Law of Exponents: Power of a Power  To raise a power to a power, keep the same base and multiply the exponents.  multiplying exponents   Notice the difference between the expressions and The first expression is a product, so we add the exponents. The second expression raises a power to a power, so we multiply the exponents.   Power of a Product  To simplify the expression , we use the associative and commutative laws to regroup the factors as follows. Thus, to raise a product to a power, we can simply raise each factor to the power.  Fourth Law of Exponents: Power of a Product  A power of a product is equal to the product of the powers of each of its factors.   .     Compare the two expressions and ; they are not the same. In the expression , only the factor is squared. But in , both and are squared. Thus, but   Compare the two expressions and . The fourth law of exponents applies to the product  , but not to the sum  . Thus, In order to simplify , we must expand the binomial product:    Power of a Quotient  To simplify the expression , we multiply together copies of the fraction . In general, we have the following rule.  Fifth Law of Exponents: Power of a Quotient  To raise a quotient to a power, raise both the numerator and denominator to the power.   For reference, we state all of the laws of exponents together. All the laws are valid when a and b are not equal to zero and when the exponents m and n are whole numbers.  Laws of Exponents          Simplify  According to the order of operations, we should perform any powers before multiplications. Thus, we begin by simplifying . We apply the fourth law. Finally, multiply powers with the same base. Apply the first law.   Simplify  Begin by applying the fifth law.    Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

  "body": "Polynomials and Factoring  In , we used the first law of exponents to multiply two or more monomials. In this section, we review techniques for multiplying and factoring polynomials of several terms.  Polynomials  A polynomial polynomial is a sum of terms in which all the exponents on the variables are whole numbers and no variables appear in the denominator or under a radical. The expressions are all examples of polynomials in one variable.  An algebraic expression consisting of one term of the form , where is a constant and is a whole number, is called a monomial monomial . For example, are monomials. A polynomial is just a sum of one or more monomials.  A polynomial with exactly two terms, such as , is called a binomial binomial . A polynomial with exactly three terms, such as or , is called a trinomial trinomial . We have no special names for polynomials with more than three terms.  Which of the following expressions are polynomials?         The first three are all polynomials. In fact, (a) is a monomial, (b) is a binomial, and (c) is a trinomial. The last three are not polynomials. The variable in (d) has a negative exponent, the variable in (e) occurs in the denominator, and the variable in (f) occurs under a radical.  In a polynomial containing only one variable, the greatest exponent that appears on the variable is called the degree degree of the polynomial. If there is no variable at all, then the polynomial is called a constant, and the degree of a constant is zero.  Give the degree of each polynomial.        This is a polynomial in the variable , and because the greatest exponent on is , the degree of this polynomial is .  This is a constant polynomial, so its degree is . (The exponent on a constant does not affect the degree.)  This monomial has degree .  This is a binomial of degree .   We can evaluate a polynomial just as we evaluate any other algebraic expression: We replace the variable with a number and simplify the result.  Let . Evaluate each of the following.       In each case, we replace by the given value.        Products of Polynomials  To multiply polynomials, we use a generalized form of the distributive property: To multiply a polynomial by a monomial, we multiply each term of the polynomial by the monomial.       Products of Binomials  Products of binomials occur so frequently that it is worthwhile to learn a shortcut for this type of multiplication. We can use the following scheme to perform the multiplication mentally. (See .)  figure identifying thefirst, outer, inner, and last terms in a binomial product  This process is sometimes called the FOIL method, where FOIL represents      Factoring  We sometimes find it useful to write a polynomial as a single term composed of two or more factors . This process is the reverse of multiplication and is called factoring factoring . For example, observe that We will only consider factorization in which the factors have integer coefficients.   Common Factors  We can factor a common factor from a polynomial by using the distributive property in the form We first identify the common factor. For example, each term of the polynomial contains the monomial as a factor; therefore, Next, we insert the proper polynomial factor within the parentheses. This factor can be determined by inspection. We ask ourselves for monomials that, when multiplied by , yield , , and , respectively, and obtain  We can check the result of factoring an expression by multiplying the factors. In the example above,    because   because    Opposite of a Binomial  It is often useful to factor from the terms of a binomial. Hence, we have the following important relationship.  Opposite of a Binomial   That is, and are opposites or negatives of each other.       Polynomial Division  We can divide one polynomial by a polynomial of lesser degree. The quotient will be the sum of a polynomial and a simpler algebraic fraction.  If the divisor is a monomial, we can simply divide the monomial into each term of the numerator.  Divide  Divide into each term of the numerator. The quotient is the sum of a polynomial, , and an algebraic fraction, .  If the denominator is not a monomial, we can use a method similar to the long division algorithm used in arithmetic.  Divide   We first write the quotient as a division problem: and divide (the first term of the numerator) by (the first term of the denominator) to obtain . (It may be helpful to write down the division: .) We write above the quotient bar as the first term of the quotient, as shown below.  Next, we multiply by to obtain , and subtract this product from : Repeating the process, we divide by to obtain . We write as the second term of the quotient. Then we multiply by to obtain , and subtract: Because the degree of the remainder, 8, is less than the degree of , the division is finished. The quotient is , with a remainder of . We write the remainder as a fraction to obtain   When using polynomial division, it helps to write the polynomials in descending powers of the variable. If the numerator is missing any terms, we can insert terms with zero coefficients so that like powers will be aligned. For example, to perform the division we first write the numerator in descending powers as . We then insert between and and set up the quotient as  long division box  We then proceed as in . You can check that the quotient is    Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

The product of the binomials is Thus, we are looking for two numbers, and , that satisfy By comparing the coefficients of the terms in the two trinomials, we see that and . That is, the sum of the two numbers is the coefficient of the linear term, , and their product is the constant term, .  To find the numbers, we list all the possible integer factorizations of : We see that only one combination gives the correct linear term: and . These are the numbers and , so  In we factor quadratic trinomials in which one or more of the coefficients is negative.  Factor.       Find two numbers whose product is and whose sum is . Because the product is positive and the sum is negative, the two numbers must both be negative. The possible factors of are and , and , or and . Only and have the correct sum, . Hence,  Find two numbers whose product is and whose sum is . Because the product is negative, the two numbers must be of opposite sign and their sum must be . By listing the possible factors of , we find that the two numbers are and . Hence,   If the coefficient of the quadratic term is not , we must also consider its factors.

Insert the proper signs:   With practice, you can usually factor trinomials of the form mentally. The following observations may help.   If , and are all positive, both signs in the factored form are positive. For example, as a first step in factoring , we could write  If and are positive and is negative, both signs in the factored form are negative. Thus as a first step in factoring , we could write  If is negative, the signs in the factored form are opposite. Thus as a first step in factoring , we could write          Special Products and Factors  The products below are special cases of the multiplication of binomials. They occur so often that you should learn to recognize them on sight.  Special Products       Notice that in (I) , and that in (II) . For example,       Each of the formulas for special products, when viewed from right to left, also represents a special case of factoring quadratic polynomials.  Special Factorizations        The trinomials in (I) and (II) are sometimes called perfect-square trinomials perfect-square trinomials because they are squares of binomials.

  "title": "Working with Algebraic Fractions",
  "body": "Working with Algebraic Fractions  A quotient of two polynomials is called a rational expression rational expression or an algebraic fraction algebraic fraction . Operations on algebraic fractions follow the same rules as operations on common fractions.  Reducing Fractions  When we reduce an ordinary fraction such as , we are using the fundamental principle of fractions.  Fundamental Principle of Fractions  If we multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same (nonzero) number, the new fraction is equivalent to the old one. In symbols,   Thus, for example,  We use the same procedure to reduce algebraic fractions: We look for common factors in the numerator and denominator and then apply the fundamental principle.  Reduce each algebraic fraction.     Factor out any common factors from the numerator and denominator. Then divide numerator and denominator by the common factors.     If the numerator or denominator of the fraction contains more than one term, it is especially important to factor before attempting to apply the fundamental principle. We can divide out common factors from the numerator and denominator of a fraction, but the fundamental principle does not apply to common terms .  We can reduce because is a common factor in the numerator and denominator. However, because is a common term but is not a common factor of the numerator and denominator. Furthermore, because is not a factor of the entire numerator.  Reduce each fraction.     Factor the numerator and denominator. Then divide numerator and denominator by the common factors.     Note that in a above, and in b,  We summarize the procedure for reducing algebraic fractions as follows.  To Reduce an Algebraic Fraction:   Factor the numerator and denominator.  Divide the numerator and denominator by any common factors.   Reduce each fraction.      Factor numerator and denominator to obtain The factor in the numerator is the opposite of the factor in the denominator. That is, . Thus,  The numerator of the fraction is a difference of two cubes, and the denominator is a difference of two squares. Factor each to obtain    Products of Fractions  To multiply two or more common fractions together, we multiply their numerators together and multiply their denominators together. The same is true for a product of algebraic fractions. For example, xy We can simplify the process by first factoring each numerator and denominator and dividing out any common factors.   In general, we have the following procedure for finding the product of algebraic fractions.  To Multiply Algebraic Fractions:   Factor each numerator and denominator.  Divide out any factors that appear in both a numerator and a denominator.  Multiply together the numerators; multiply together the denominators.   Find each product.      The denominator of the first fraction factors into . There are no common factors to divide out, so we multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.  Factor each numerator and each denominator. Look for common factors.    Quotients of Fractions  To divide two algebraic fractions we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. For example,  If the fractions involve polynomials of more than one term, we may need to factor each numerator and denominator in order to recognize any common factors. This suggests the following procedure for dividing algebraic fractions.  To Divide Algebraic Fractions:   Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.  Factor each numerator and denominator.  Divide out any factors that appear in both a numerator and a denominator.  Multiply together the numerators; multiply together the denominators.   Find each quotient.      Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.  Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.    Sums and Differences of Like Fractions  Algebraic fractions with the same denominator are called like fractions like fractions . To add or subtract like fractions, we combine their numerators and keep the same denominator for the sum or difference. This method is an application of the distributive law.  Find each sum or difference.      Because these are like fractions, we add their numerators and keep the same denominator.  Be careful to subtract the entire numerator of the second fraction: Use parentheses to show that the subtraction applies to both terms of .    Lowest Common Denominator  To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, we must first find a common denominator common denominator .  For arithmetic fractions, we use the smallest natural number that is exactly divisible by each of the given denominators. For example, to add the fractions and , we use as the common denominator because is the smallest natural number that both and divide into evenly.  We define the lowest common denominator lowest common denominator ( LCD LCD ) of two or more algebraic fractions as the polynomial of least degree that is exactly divisible by each of the given denominators.  Find the LCD for the fractions and   The LCD is a polynomial that has as factors both and . The simplest such polynomial is , or . For our purposes, it will be more convenient to leave the LCD in factored form, so the LCD is .  The LCD in was easy to find because each original denominator consisted of a single factor; that is, neither denominator could be factored. In that case, the LCD is just the product of the original denominators.  We can always find a common denominator by multiplying together all the denominators in the given fractions, but this may not give us the simplest or lowest common denominator. Using anything other than the simplest possible common denominator will complicate our work needlessly.  If any of the denominators in the given fractions can be factored, we factor them before looking for the LCD.  To Find the LCD of Algebraic Fractions:   Factor each denominator completely.  Include each different factor in the LCD as many times as it occurs in any one of the given denominators.   Find the LCD for the fractions and .  Factor the denominators of each of the given fractions. The factor occurs once in the first denominator, the factor occurs once in the second denominator, and the factor occurs once in each denominator. Therefore, we include in our LCD one copy of each of these factors. The LCD is .  In , we do not include two factors of in the LCD. We need only one factor of because occurs only once in either denominator. You should check that each original denominator divides evenly into our LCD, .   Building Fractions  After finding the LCD, we build build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as its denominator. The new fractions will be like fractions, and we can combine them as explained above.  Building a fraction is the opposite of reducing a fraction, in the sense that we multiply, rather than divide, the numerator and denominator by an appropriate factor. To find the building factor building factor , we compare the factors of the original denominator with those of the desired common denominator.  Build each of the fractions and to equivalent fractions with the LCD as denominator.  Compare the denominator of the given fraction to the LCD. We see that the fraction needs a factor of in its denominator, so is the building factor for the first fraction. We multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by to obtain an equivalent fraction: The fraction needs a factor of in the denominator, so we multiply numerator and denominator by :   The two new fractions we obtained in are like fractions; they have the same denominator.   Sums and Differences of Unlike Fractions  We are now ready to add or subtract algebraic fractions with unlike denominators. We will do this in four steps.  To Add or Subtract Fractions with Unlike Denominators:   Find the LCD for the given fractions.  Build each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as its denominator.  Add or subtract the numerators of the resulting like fractions. Use the LCD as the denominator of the sum or difference.  Reduce the sum or difference, if possible.   Subtract .    The LCD for these fractions is .  We build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD, as we did in .  Combine the numerators over the same denominator.  Reduce the result, if possible. If we factor both numerator and denominator, we find The fraction cannot be reduced.   Write as a single fraction: .   To find the LCD, factor each denominator: The LCD is .  Build each term to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as denominator. (The building factors for each fraction are shown in color.) The third fraction already has the LCD for its denominator.  Combine the numerators over the LCD.  Reduce the fraction to find    Complex Fractions  A fraction that contains one or more fractions in either its numerator or its denominator or both is called a complex fraction. For example, are complex fractions. Like simple fractions, complex fractions represent quotients. For the examples above, We can always simplify a complex fraction into a standard algebraic fraction. If the denominator of the complex fraction is a single term, we can treat the fraction as a division problem and multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator. Thus,  If the numerator or denominator of the complex fraction contains more than one term, it is easier to use the fundamental principle of fractions to simplify the expression.  Simplify  Consider all of the simple fractions that appear in the complex fraction; in this example and . The LCD of these fractions is . If we multiply the numerator and denominator of the complex fraction by , we will eliminate the fractions within the fraction.  Be sure to multiply each term of the numerator and each term of the denominator by . Thus, the original complex fraction is equivalent to the simple fraction .   We summarize the method for simplifying complex fractions as follows.  To Simplify a Complex Fraction:   Find the LCD of all the fractions contained in the complex fraction.  Multiply each term in the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction by the LCD.  Reduce the resulting simple fraction, if possible.     Negative Exponents  Algebraic fractions are sometimes written using negative exponents. (You can review negative exponents in .  Write each expression as a single algebraic fraction.         When working with fractions and exponents, it is important to avoid some tempting but incorrect algebraic operations.   In a, note that For example, you can check that for and ,  In b, note that   In general, the fourth law of exponents does not apply to sums and differences; that is,    Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

  "body": "Working with Radicals  Sometimes radical notation is more convenient to use than exponents. In these cases, we usually simplify radical expressions algebraically as much as possible before using a calculator to obtain decimal approximations.  Properties of Radicals  Because , we can use the laws of exponents to derive two important properties that are useful in simplifying radicals.  Properties of Radicals       As examples, you can verify that  Which of the following are true?  Is  Is  Is  Is   The statements in (b) and (d) are true, and both are examples of the first property of radicals.  Statements (a) and (c) are false. In general, is not equal to , and is not equal to .   Simplifying Radicals  We use Property (1) to simplify radical expressions by factoring the radicand. For example, to simplify , we look for perfect cubes that divide evenly into . The easiest way to do this is to try the perfect cubes in order: and so on, until we find one that is a factor. For this example, we find that . Using Property (1), we write Simplify the first factor to find This expression is considered simpler than the original radical because the new radicand, , is smaller than the original, .  We can also simplify radicals containing variables. If the exponent on the variable is a multiple of the index, we can extract the variable from the radical. For instance, (You can verify this by noting that .) If the exponent on the variable is not a multiple of the index, we factor out the highest power that is a multiple. For example,  Simplify each radical.      The index of the radical is , so we look for perfect square factors of . The factor is a perfect square, and has an exponent divisible by . Thus,  The index of the radical is , so we look for perfect cube factors of . The factor is a perfect cube, and and have exponents divisible by . Thus,   Property (1) applies only to products under the radical, not to sums or differences. Thus, for example, and   To simplify roots of fractions, we use Property (2), which allows us to write the expression as a quotient of two radicals.      We can also use Properties (1) and (2) to simplify products and quotients of radicals.  Simplify.      First apply Property (1) to write the product as a single radical, then simplify.  Apply Property (2) to write the quotient as a single radical.    Sums and Differences of Radicals  You know that sums or differences of like terms can be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients: Like radicals, that is, radicals of the same index and radicand, can be combined in the same way.       In a, . Only the coefficients are added; the radicand does not change.  Sums of radicals with different radicands or different indices cannot be combined. Thus,  and None of the expressions above can be simplified.    Products of Radicals  According to Property (1), radicals of the same index can be multiplied together.  Product of Radicals     Thus, for example,  For products involving binomials, we can apply the distributive law.       Rationalizing the Denominator  It is easier to work with radicals if there are no roots in the denominators of fractions. We can use the fundamental principle of fractions to remove radicals from the denominator. This process is called rationalizing the denominator rationalizing the denominator . For square roots, we multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the radical in the denominator.  Rationalize the denominator of each fraction.      Apply Property (2) to write the radical as a quotient.  It is always best to simplify the denominator before rationalizing.   If the denominator of a fraction is a binomial in which one or both terms is a radical, we can use a special building factor to rationalize it. First, recall that where the product consists of perfect squares only. Each of the two factors and is said to be the conjugate conjugate of the other.  Now consider a fraction of the form If we multiply the numerator and denominator of this fraction by the conjugate of the denominator, we get The denominator of the fraction no longer contains any radicals—it has been rationalized.  Multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator also works on fractions of the form We leave the verification of these cases as exercises.  Rationalize the denominator: .  Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, .   Simplifying  Raising to a power is the inverse operation for extracting roots; that is,   as long as is a real number. For example,  Now consider the power and root operations in the opposite order; is it true that ? If the index is an odd number, then the statement is always true. For example, However, if is even, we must be careful. Recall that the principal root is always positive, so if is a negative number, it cannot be true that . For example, if , then Instead, we see that, for even roots, .  We summarize our results in below.  Roots of Powers   If is odd,  If is even,  In particular,        Extraneous Solutions to Radical Equations  It is important to check the solution to a radical equation, because it is possible to introduce false, or extraneous extraneous solution , solutions when we square both sides of the equation. For example, the equation has no solution, because is never a negative number. However, if we try to solve the equation by squaring both sides, we find You can check that is not a solution to the original equation, , because does not equal .  If each side of an equation is raised to an odd power, extraneous solutions will not be introduced. However, if we raise both sides to an even power, we should check each solution in the original equation.  Solve the equation .  First, isolate the radical expression on one side of the equation. (This will make it easier to square both sides.)  Check  Does ?    Does ?    The apparent solution is extraneous. The only solution to the original equation is . We can verify the solution by graphing the equations   as shown at right. The graphs intersect in only one point, , so there is only one solution, .  graphs of both sides of radical equation  When we square both sides of an equation, it is not correct to square each term of the equation separately. Thus, in , the original equation is not equivalent to This is because . Instead, we must square the entire left side of the equation as a binomial, like this, or we may proceed as shown in .   Equations with More than One Radical  Sometimes it is necessary to square both sides of an equation more than once in order to eliminate all the radicals.  Solve .  First, isolate the more complicated radical on one side of the equation. (This will make it easier to square both sides.) We will subtract from both sides. Now square each side to remove one radical. Be careful when squaring the binomial . Collect like terms, and isolate the radical on one side of the equation. Now square again to obtain  Check Does ?    Recall that we cannot solve a radical equation by squaring each term separately. In other words, it is incorrect to begin by writing We must square the entire expression on each side of the equal sign as one piece.

  "body": "Facts from Geometry  In this section, we review some information you will need from geometry. You are already familiar with the formulas for the area and perimeter of common geometric figures; you can find these formulas in the reference section .  Right Triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem  A right triangle right triangle is a triangle in which one of the angles is a right angle, or . Because the sum of the three angles in any triangle is , this means that the other two angles in a right triangle must have a sum of , or . For instance, if we know that one of the angles in a right triangle is , then the remaining angle must be , or , as shown at right.  right triangle with a 37 deg and a 53 deg angle  In the right triangle shown at right, the medium-sized angle is less than twice the smallest angle. Find the sizes of the three angles.  right triangle   Step 1 Let stand for the size of the smallest angle. Then the medium-sized angle must be .  Step 2 Because the right angle is the largest angle, the sum of the smallest and medium-sized angles must be the remaining . Thus,  Step 3 Solve the equation. Begin by simplifying the left side.  Step 4 The smallest angle is , and the medium-sized angle is , or .   In a right triangle, the longest side is opposite the right angle and is called the hypotenuse hypotenuse . Ordinarily, even if we know the lengths of two sides of a triangle, it is not easy to find the length of the third side (to solve this problem we need trigonometry), but for the special case of a right triangle, there is an equation that relates the lengths of the three sides. This property of right triangles was known to many ancient cultures, and we know it today by the name of a Greek mathematician, Pythagoras, who provided a proof of the result.  Pythagorean Theorem   In a right triangle, if stands for the length of the hypotenuse and and stand for the lengths of the two sides, then  right triangle   The hypotenuse of a right triangle is feet long. The third side is twice the length of the shortest side. Find the lengths of the other 2 sides. right triangle   Step 1 Let represent the length of the shortest side, so that the third side has length .   Step 2 Substituting these expressions into the Pythagorean theorem, we find  Step 3 This is a quadratic equation with no linear term, so we simplify and then isolate . Taking square roots of both sides yields  Step 4 Because a length must be a positive number, the shortest side has length approximately feet, and the third side has length , or approximately feet.    Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles  Recall also that an isosceles isosceles triangle is one that has at least two sides of equal length. In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides, called the base base angles, are equal in measure. In an equilateral triangle, all three sides have equal length, and all three angles have equal measure.  isoscles and equilateral triangles   The Triangle Inequality  The longest side in a triangle is always opposite the largest angle, and the shortest side is opposite the smallest angle.   It is also true that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side, or else the two sides will not meet to form a triangle! This fact is called the triangle inequality triangle inequality .  In the triangle at right, we must have that , where , , and are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.  triangle of sides p, q, and r  Now we can use the triangle inequality to discover information about the sides of a triangle.  Two sides of a triangle have lengths inches and inches. What can you say about the length of the third side?   Let represent the length of the third side of the triangle. By the triangle inequality, we must have that Looking at another pair of sides, we must also have that  triangle with two sides of length 7 and 10 inches  Thus the third side must be greater than inches but less than inches long.   Similar Triangles  Two triangles are said to be similar similar if their corresponding angles are equal. This means that the two triangles will have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. One of the triangles will be an enlargement or a reduction of the other; so their corresponding sides are proportional.  In other words, for similar triangles, the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal .  similar triangle  If any two pairs of corresponding angles of two triangles are equal, then the third pair must also be equal, because in both triangles the sum of the angles is . Thus, to show that two triangles are similar, we need only show that two pairs of angles are equal.  The roof of an A-frame ski chalet forms an isosceles triangle with the floor. The floor of the chalet is feet wide, and the ceiling is feet tall at the center. If a loft is built at a height of feet from the floor, how wide will the loft be?  dimensions of A-frame roof   Look at the diagram of the chalet at right. We can show that is similar to . Both triangles include , and because is parallel to , is equal to . Thus, the triangles have two pairs of equal angles and are therefore similar triangles.  dimensions of A-frame roof   Step 1 Let stand for the width of the loft.  Step 2 First note that if , then . Because is similar to , the ratios of their corresponding sides (or corresponding altitudes) are equal. In particular,   Step 3 Solve the proportion for . Begin by cross-multiplying.  Step 4 The floor of the loft will be feet wide.    Volume and Surface Area  The volume volume of a three-dimensional object measures its capacity, or how much space it encloses. Volume is measured in cubic units, such as cubic inches or cubic meters.   The volume of a rectangular prism, or box, is given by the product of its length, width, and height. For example, the volume of the box of length inches, width inches, and height inches shown at right is  box  Formulas for the volumes of other common objects can be found inside the front cover of the book.    A cylindrical can must have a height of inches, but it can have any reasonable radius.   Write an algebraic expression for the volume of the can in terms of its radius.    If the volume of the can should be approximately cubic inches, what should its radius be?          The formula for the volume of a right circular cylinder is . If the height of the cylinder is inches, then , or .  cylinder    Substitute for and solve for . Thus, the radius of the can should be approximately inches. A calculator keying sequence for the expression above is    2nd           ENTER       The surface area surface area of a solid object is the sum of the areas of all the exterior faces of the object. It measures the amount of paper that would be needed to cover the object entirely. Since it is an area, it is measured in square units.  Write a formula for the surface area of a closed box in terms of its length, width, and height.  box  The box has six sides; we must find the area of each side and add them.  The top and bottom of the box each have area , so together they contribute to the surface area.  The back and front of the box each have area , so they contribute to the surface area.  Finally, the left and right sides of the box each have area , so they add to the surface area.  Thus, the total surface area is   The Distance Formula  By using the Pythagorean theorem, we can derive a formula for the distance between two points, and , in terms of their coordinates. We first label a right triangle, as we did in the example above. Draw a horizontal line through and a vertical line through . These lines meet at a point , as shown below. The -coordinate of is the same as the -coordinate of , and the -coordinate of is the same as the -coordinate of . Thus, the coordinates of are .  box  The distance between and is , and the distance between and is . (See to review distance and absolute value.)  These two numbers are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle. The length of the hypotenuse is the distance between and , which we will call . By the Pythagorean theorem, Taking the (positive) square root of each side of this equation gives us the distance formula distance formula .  Distance Formula distance formula  The distance  between points and is  Find the distance between and   Substitute for and substitute for in the distance formula to obtain   In , we obtain the same answer if we use for and use for :   The Midpoint Formula  If we know the coordinates of two points, we can calculate the coordinates of the point halfway between them using the midpoint midpoint formula. Each coordinate of the midpoint is the average of the corresponding coordinates of the two points.  Midpoint Formula midpoint formula  The midpoint midpoint of the line segment joining the points and is the point , where   Find the midpoint of the line segment joining the points and .  Substitute for and for in the midpoint formula to obtain The midpoint of the segment is the point .   Circles  A circle circle is the set of all points in a plane that lie at a given distance, called the radius radius , from a fixed point called the center center .  We can use the distance formula to find an equation for a circle. First consider the circle (a) below, whose center is the origin, .  a circle centered at origin and a circle centered at (h,k)  The distance from the origin to any point on the circle is . Therefore, Or, squaring both sides, Thus, the equation for a circle of radius centered at the origin is  Now consider the circle (b) above, whose center is the point . Every point on the circle lies a distance from , so the equation of the circle is given by the following formula.

It is easy to graph a circle if its equation is given in standard form.  Graph the circles.      The graph of is a circle with radius and center at . To sketch the graph, first locate the center of the circle. (The center is not part of the graph of the circle.)

The center of the circle is the midpoint of its diameter. Use the midpoint formula to find the center:  circle with given endpoints of a diameter  Thus, the center is the point . The radius is the distance from the center to either of the endpoints of the diameter, say the point . Use the distance formula with the points and to find the radius. Finally, substitute for and for (the coordinates of the center) and for (the radius) into the standard form to obtain    Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

  "body": "Properties of Lines  Horizontal and Vertical Lines  Two special cases of linear equations are worth noting. First, an equation such as can be thought of as an equation in two variables, For each value of , this equation assigns the value to . Thus, any ordered pair of the form is a solution of the equation. For example, are all solutions of the equation. If we draw a straight line through these points, we obtain the horizontal line shown at left below.    horizontal line     vertical line     The other special case of a linear equation is of the type , or Here, only one value is permissible for , namely , while any value may be assigned to . Any ordered pair of the form is a solution of this equation. If we choose two solutions, say and , and draw a straight line through these two points, we have the vertical line shown at right above. In general, we have the following results.  The graph of ( a constant) is a vertical line.  The graph of ( a constant) is a horizontal line.   Graph .  Graph .    horline  verline   Now let's compute the slopes of the two lines in the previous example. Choose two points on the graph of , say and . Use these points to compute the slope. The slope of the horizontal line is zero. In fact, the slope of any horizontal line is zero, because the -coordinates of all the points on the line are equal. Thus On a vertical line, the -coordinates of all the points are equal. For example, two points on the line are and . Using these points to compute the slope, we find which is undefined. The slope of any vertical line is undefined because the expression equals zero.  The slope of a horizontal line is zero.  The slope of a vertical line is undefined.   Parallel and Perpendicular Lines  Consider the graphs of the equations shown below.   parallel lines    The lines have the same slope, , but different -intercepts. Because slope measures the steepness or inclination of a line, lines with the same slope are parallel .  Two lines with slopes and are parallel if and only if .  Are the graphs of the equations and parallel?  The lines are parallel if their slopes are equal. We can find the slope of the first line by putting its equation into slope-intercept form. We solve for : The slope of the first line is . The equation of the second line is already in slope-intercept form, and its slope is . Thus, , so the lines are parallel.  Now consider the graphs of the equations shown below.   perpendicular lines    The lines appear to be perpendicular . The relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines is not as easy to see as the relationship for parallel lines. However, for this example, and . Note that This relationship holds for any two perpendicular lines with slopes and , as long as and .  Two lines with slopes and are perpendicular if .  We say that is the negative reciprocal of .  Are the graphs of and perpendicular?  We find the slope of each line by putting the equations into slope-intercept form. For the first line, so . For the second line, , so . Now, the negative reciprocal of is but . Thus, , so the lines are not perpendicular.   Applications to Geometry  These relationships for the slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines can help us solve numerous geometric problems.  Show that the triangle with vertices and shown below is a right triangle.   right triangle    We will show that two of the sides of the triangle are perpendicular. The line segment has slope and the line segment has slope Because the sides and are perpendicular, and the triangle is a right triangle.  Consider the graph of shown below.   parallel lines    Can we find the equation of the line that is parallel to this line, but passes through the point ? If we can find the slope of the desired line, we can use the slope-intercept formula to find its equation.  Now because the line we want is parallel to the given line, they must have the same slope. To find the slope of the given line, we write its equation in slope-intercept form: The slope of the given line is . Because the unknown line is parallel to this line, its slope is also . Now we know the slope of the desired line, , and one point on the line, . Substituting these values into the point-slope formula will give us the equation.  Find an equation for the line that passes through the point and is perpendicular to the line .  We follow the same strategy as in the discussion above: First find the slope of the desired line, then use the point-slope formula to write its equation.  The line we want is perpendicular to the given line, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of , the slope of the given line. Thus Now we use the point-slope formula with and .

The integers are rational numbers, and so are common fractions. Some examples of rational numbers are and . The set of rational numbers is denoted by .  Every rational number has a decimal form that either terminates or repeats a pattern of digits. For example, and where the pattern of digits is repeated endlessly. We use the repeater bar repeater bar notation to write a repeating decimal fraction:   Irrational Numbers  Some real numbers cannot be written in the form , where and are integers. For example, the number is not equal to any common fraction. Such numbers are called irrational numbers irrational numbers . Examples of irrational numbers are and .  The decimal form of an irrational number never terminates, and its digits do not follow a repeating pattern, so it is impossible to write down an exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number. However, we can obtain decimal approximations correct to any desired degree of accuracy by rounding off. A graphing calculator gives the decimal representation of as . This is not the exact value of , but for most calculations it is quite adequate.  Some th roots are rational numbers and some are irrational numbers. For example, are rational numbers because they are equal to and , respectively. On the other hand, are irrational numbers. We can use a calculator to obtain decimal approximations for each of these numbers:  The subsets of the real numbers are related as shown in . Every natural number is also a whole number, every whole number is an integer, every integer is a rational number, and every rational number is real. Also, every real number is either rational or irrational.  real numbers    is a natural number, a whole number, an integer, a rational number, and a real number.  is an irrational number and a real number.  The number , whose decimal representation begins is irrational and real.  is a rational and real number (which is close but not exactly equal to ).    Properties of the Real Numbers  The real numbers have several useful properties governing the operations of addition and multiplication. If , , and represent real numbers, then each of the following equations is true:       These properties do not mention subtraction or division. But we can define subtraction and division in terms of addition and multiplication. For example, we can define the difference as follows: where , the additive inverse additive inverse (or opposite opposite ) of , is the number that satisfies Similarly, we can define the quotient : where , the multiplicative inverse multiplicative inverse (or reciprocal reciprocal ) of , is the number that satisfies  Division by zero is not defined.  Use the commutative and associative laws to simplify the computations.      Apply the commutative law of addition.  Apply the commutative law of multiplication.    Order Properties of the Real Numbers  Real numbers obey properties about order, that is, properties about inequalities. The familiar inequality symbols, and , have the following properties:  If and are any real numbers, then one of three things is true:  (Transitive property) For real numbers , , and ,  We also have three properties that are useful for solving inequalities:  If , then .  If and , then .  If and , then .    If and , then  , so .  , so     Section Summary  Vocabulary  Look up the definitions of new terms in the Glossary.

Tracing  The calculator can display the coordinates of selected points on the graph. Press the TRACE key to see a \"bug\" blinking on the graph. The coordinates of the bug are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the bug along the graph, as shown in .

  "title": "GNU Free Documentation License",
  "body": " GNU Free Documentation License   Version 1.3, 3 November 2008  Copyright copyright 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. < >  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.    0. PREAMBLE  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document free in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.  This License is a kind of copyleft , which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The Document , below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as you . You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.  A Modified Version of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.  A Secondary Section is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.  The Invariant Sections are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.  The Cover Texts are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.  A Transparent copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not Transparent is called Opaque .  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.  The Title Page means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, Title Page means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.  The publisher means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.  A section Entitled XYZ means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as Acknowledgements , Dedications , Endorsements , or History .) To Preserve the Title of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section Entitled XYZ according to this definition.  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.    2. VERBATIM COPYING  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.    4. MODIFICATIONS  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:  Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.  State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.  Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.  Include an unaltered copy of this License.  Preserve the section Entitled History , Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled History in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.  Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the History section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.  For any section Entitled Acknowledgements or Dedications , Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.  Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.  Delete any section Entitled Endorsements . Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.  Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled Endorsements or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.  Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.  You may add a section Entitled Endorsements , provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled History in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled History ; likewise combine any sections Entitled Acknowledgements , and any sections Entitled Dedications . You must delete all sections Entitled Endorsements .    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an aggregate if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.    8. TRANSLATION  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.  If a section in the Document is Entitled Acknowledgements , Dedications , or History , the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.    9. TERMINATION  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See .  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License or any later version applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.    11. RELICENSING  Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site (or MMC Site ) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A Massive Multiauthor Collaboration (or MMC ) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.  CC-BY-SA means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.  Incorporate means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.  An MMC is eligible for relicensing if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.  The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.    "
