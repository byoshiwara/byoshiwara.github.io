<p>If you count by even numbers, such as 6, 8, 10, et cetera, you are listing consecutive even integers.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>If your first even integer is \(n\text{,}\) what is the next even integer?</li>
<li>What is the next even integer after that?</li>
<li>Write a polynomial for the product of the three even integers in parts (a) and (b).</li>

By modeling the development of storm tilt, a better understanding of a tropical cyclone's behavior is gained in the presence and absence of wind shear.  In particular, an El Niño weather system creates changes in the jet stream over the Northern Hemisphere, resultingin decreased wind shear in the Pacific and increased wind shear across much of the Atlantic basin, which suppresses hurricane activity.</p>
