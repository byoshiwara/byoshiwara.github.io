<p>We have included a number of features to encourage student participation.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The reading is broken into small segments by using boxes around Examples, definitions, and rules, and flags including Caution, Look Closer, and Look Ahead.</li>
<li>We want students to learn how to read a math book, so we have included Reading Questions that mirror the content of the lesson.  For example, the first Reading Question is "A numerical quantity that changes over time or in different situations is called a \(\underline{\hspace{2.727272727272727em}}\text{.}\)" Ideally, students would answer these questions before class, perhaps through an on-line homework system.</li>
<li>Each section ends with a Skills Warm-Up (with answers) for students to complete on their own. The Skills Warm-Up problems review an arithmetic or algebraic technique needed for the Lesson that follows.</li>
<li>Because choosing appropriate scales for the axes is a time-consuming task for beginning students, the text includes labeled grids for most of the graphing exercises. Ready-made grids allow students to consider a wider range of examples (with "harder" numbers) and to focus on the properties of the graphs, such as intercepts and slope, and on interpreting the information given by the graph. If students are using technology to create graphs, the grids can help them choose an appropriate window.</li>
</ul>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In his beautiful book, <em class="emphasis">Trigonometric Delights</em>, Eli Maor enjoins us "Let's not forget that trigonometry is, first and foremost, a practical discipline, born out of and deeply rooted in applications."  After the New Math "[f]ormal definitions and legalistic verbosity—all in the name of mathematical rigor—replaced a real understanding of the subject."  And formalism is "... certainly not the best way to motivate the beginning student."</p>
