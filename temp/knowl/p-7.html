<p>Consequently, our text may differ in some ways from other treatments of the subject.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>We begin with writing algebraic expressions instead of manipulating expressions. We use tables and graphs to motivate expressions.</li>
<li>Graphing appears in Chapter 1 and is continued throughout the book. Graphs are not restricted to \(10 \times 10\) grids.</li>
<li>We solve equations both algebraically and graphically.</li>
<li>Standard word problems are de-emphasized in favor of modeling.</li>
<li>Quadratic expressions and equations are treated before polynomials. We start with quadratic equations that can be solved by extracting roots.</li>
<li>We try to minimize factoring in the study of algebraic fractions.</li>
</ul>
=======
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Throughout we have been guided by the Rule of Four and use tables and graphical representation to illustrate concepts.  We have taken care to include numerical examples and diagrams, both in Examples and in Homework Problems, to offer students some intuitive understanding for the more abstract ideas of trigonometry.  Above all, we have tried to focus on the fundamental ideas of trigonometry by introducing them in their most basic form and returning later to look at them in greater detail.</p>
