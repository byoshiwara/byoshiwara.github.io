<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In a psychology experiment, volunteers were asked to memorize a list of nonsense words, and 24 hours later they were tested to see how many of the words they recalled. On average, the subjects had forgotten 20% of the words. The researchers found that the more lists their volunteers memorized, the larger the fraction of words they were unable to recall.
