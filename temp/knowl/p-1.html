<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><dfn class="terminology">Elementary Algebra: Equations and Graphs</dfn> was written with two goals in mind: to present the skills of algebra in the context of modeling and problem solving, and to engage students in an activity-based course.</p>
=======
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We have tried to make this edition of <em class="emphasis">Trigonometry</em> useful to students in a variety of programs.  For example, students who have encountered elements of triangle trig in previous courses may be able to skip all or part of Chapters 1 through 3.  Students preparing for technical courses may not need much of the material after Chapter 6 or 7.  Chapters 9 and 10 cover vectors and polar coordinates, optional topics that occur in some trigonometry courses but are often reserved for precalculus.</p>
