<p>The content of the text follows our "guiding principles:"</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Develop the concepts and skills of algebra in context. Use applications to motivate and illustrate techniques. Don't frontload with "theory" or general principles.</li>
<li>Keep reading sections short and keep terminology to a minimum.</li>
<li>A solid understanding of basic algebra is more important than facility with complicated algorithms and procedures.</li>
<li>Include graphing from the beginning. The ability to read and analyze graphs is just as important as mastering algebraic skills. Emphasize the connection between equations and their graphs.</li>
<li>Present material by increasing levels of sophistication, not by taxonomy. In other words, don't have one chapter on simplifying expressions, and then a separate chapter on solving all kinds of equations, and so on. Instead, develop algebraic skills (writing expressions, solving equations, modeling) simultaneously and incrementally.</li>
<li>Review arithmetic skills "just-in-time" as needed (and often).</li>
<li>Some more advanced topics can be left for later courses, e.g. factoring sums of cubes.</li>
</ul>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In addition to the Homework Problems, each Example in the book is followed by a similar Exercise for students to test their understanding.  Each Section concludes with a Summary , a set of Study Questions, and a list of Skills to be addressed in the Homework.  A Summary and a set of Review Problems follows each chapter.  Chapters 1 through 8 include Activities for students to work through some of the main ideas.  We have described the use of a graphing calculator, but other graphing utilities can easily be substituted.</p>
