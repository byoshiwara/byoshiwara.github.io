<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The degree measure of an angle depends only on the fraction of a whole rotation between its sides, and not on the location or position of the angle.  To compare and analyze angles, we place them in standard position, so that the vertex of the angle is located at the origin and its initial side lies on the positive \(x\)-axis. The figure below shows several angles placed in standard position.</p>
