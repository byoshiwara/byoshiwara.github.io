<div style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px"><img src="http://presspage-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/1455/500_curtbennett-4a.jpg?x=1497642687830" alt="Curtis Bennett"  width="300"></div>
<div>
  <p>This summer the MAA Congress met to discuss how the organization is moving forward. Deputy Executive Director Doug Ensley will be stepping down from his role, and Rachel Levy will be replacing him. All of us are grateful to Doug for the excellent work he did during his term.</p>
  <p>One of the strengths of the MAA is the many circles that make up the community, the SIGMAAs, Project NExT, Committees and the links to other mathematical organizations. If you are interested in finding subgroups of the MAA for networking, professional development, or just to see what they are doing, please visit <a href="https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities" target="_blank">https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities</a> and browse around. While you’re there, please think about volunteering for committees that might interest you.</p>
<p>A topic of continuing discussion has been to better define the role of the Congress. As you may remember, the new by-laws that were passed at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in 2017 led to changing the old Governor’s Board to a Congress; meanwhile the old Executive Board of the MAA (and a few more members) became the new Governing Board. Consequently, 18 months into the new era, we are still sorting out what is the best way for the Congress to work, to advocate for changes, and to help the Governing Board collectively manage the association. One crucial concern is that because certain actions of the Governing Board require confidentiality, as currently set, there are items that can only be shared with Congress after they have ceased being confidential. I anticipate the Congress will be addressing this issue at their next meeting.</p>

<p>One such item was the decision to terminate the long-standing agreement between the AMS and MAA to manage the Joint Mathematics Meetings beginning in 2022. Be sure to read Deanna Haunsperger’s upcoming column on this in the MAA Focus. The MAA asks everyone to remember that the AMS made the decision to withdraw from the summer meetings in 1998, so this splitting is not unprecedented. Indeed, we anticipate (and the AMS has indicated) that there will continue to be sessions hosted by the MAA at the Joint Mathematics Meetings. However, it also seems likely that MAA activities will decrease somewhat too. Please know that Congress has been informed that we will help set priorities for the future.</p>

<p>Let me take this chance then to say how important it is that we select motivated individuals to run as our representatives to Congress this spring. Please forward any names you have for who should be our next representative to me, and I will make sure the nominating committee gets those names. We also need to find new officers this year for several of our positions. As is the case every year, we need a Vice Chair and a 2nd Vice Program Chair. In addition, it is time to select a new Secretary for the Section. If you are interested, please let <a href="http://sections.maa.org/socalnv/govmnt.html" target="Officers">us</a> know!</p>
<p>Until next newsletter… Curtis Bennett</p>

<h3>Jennifer Switkes Receives the Section's 2018 Teaching Award</h3>
<div style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;">
<img src="https://www.cpp.edu/~sci/img/calculus12.png" alt="Jennifer Switkes" width="300"></div>
<div>
<p>Professor Jennifer Switkes of California Polytechnic University Pomona is the winner of this year’s Section Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics and a nominee for the national MAA’s 2019 Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics.</p>
<p>Dr. Switkes is recognized for bringing her educational core values of excellence, honor, integrity, love, and purpose to all students, and specifically to traditionally underserved students.</p>
<p>Dr. Switkes makes extensive use of projects in all her courses, and always includes some content which forces the students to address issues not specifically asked for. Students extend and apply the concepts and algorithms that have been learned in class to large-scale and hands-on problems. The inclusion of a research component allows the students to challenge themselves and gives them an opportunity to see how mathematical research can be conducted. As a former student describes her experience with Dr. Switkes’ methods, “During this time we expanded a recently developed iterative numerical integration technique to higher dimensions, programmed the method in MATLAB, and used difference equations to derive closed-form formulas for specific examples. Working on this project with Dr. Switkes introduced me to the extensive community of  mathematics by presenting our work at five undergraduate research conferences and publishing a paper in <journal-title>The Mathematical Scientist</journal-title>. This was my first research project, and it sent me on a trajectory to become a research intern at MIT and subsequently to be accepted to MIT’s Ph.D. program.” </p>
<p>Professor Switkes’ teaching efforts in mathematics extend well beyond Cal Poly Pomona classrooms--she has a missionary dedication in her desire to volunteer to teach underserved
student populations. A few years ago she began teaching calculus at the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco, CA through the Prison Education Project. She developed strategies to focus the students’ attention on the big ideas on calculus, but she didn’t even know if she would have the same students week after week.
</p>
<p>The MAA Southern California-Nevada Section recognizes the great positive impact Dr. Jennifer Switkes has had on mathematics education  and is honored to present her with the Secton Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics.

<h3>News of the Section</h3>
<p><strong>California State University</strong> mathematics professor <strong>Silvia Heubach</strong> received the prestigious Faculty Innovation and Leadership Award for her innovative teaching practices that have increased student success in mathematics. Silvia Heubach is one of only 26 faculty members in the California State University system to receive this award honoring faculty leaders who have implemented innovative practices that significantly improve student success.</p>

<p>The Advanced Mathematics Program (AMP) at <strong>UC Riverside</strong>, is devoted to equity through advancing the careers of our underrepresented undergraduate math majors. To accomplish this goal, AMP holds preparatory seminars in abstract algebra and real analysis. Also, it offers talks from active mathematicians, mentoring, and assistance in applying to conferences.  The 2018 program took place from July 2 to July 27 and was funded by a 2018 MAA Tensor-SUMMA (Strengthening Underrepresented Minority Mathematics Achievement). The Advanced Mathematics Program will continue next summer, and we are now investigating grants to support our 2019 workshops.
