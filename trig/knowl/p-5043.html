<p>You are familiar with the graphs of many equations in Cartesian coordinates, including lines, parabolas and other conic sections, and the graphs of basic functions. You should now become familiar with some standard graphs in polar coordinates. These include circles and roses, cardioids and lima√ßons, lemniscates, and spirals. At the end of this section you will find a Catalog of the basic polar graphs and their properties. You can use your calculator, set in Polar mode, to experiment with these graphs.</p>
