<p>We begin as usual, by taking the inverse sine of each side of the equation, to get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2x=\sin^{-1}(0.5)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>There are two values of \(2x\) between \(0\) and \(2\pi\) with \(\sin 2x=0.5\) namely \(2x=\dfrac{\pi}{6}\) and  \(2x=\pi - \dfrac{\pi}{6}=\dfrac{5\pi}{6}\text{.}\)  Solving these equations for \(x\) yields \(x=\dfrac{\pi}{12}\) and \(x=\dfrac{5\pi}{12}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>But these are only two of the four solutions!  The graph of \(y=\sin 2x\) completes <em class="emphasis">two</em> cycles between \(0\) and \(2\pi\text{,}\) each of length \(\pi\text{.}\)  We must add \(\pi\) to each of the first two solutions to find the solutions in the second cycle.  These two solutions are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\dfrac{\pi}{12}+\pi=\dfrac{13\pi}{12}~~ \text{and}~~  \dfrac{5\pi}{12}+\pi=\dfrac{17\pi}{12}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note that the solutions in the second cycle are still less than \(2\pi\text{,}\) so they must be included in the set of all solutions between \(0\) and \(2\pi\text{.}\)  The four solutions are \(\dfrac{\pi}{12},~\dfrac{5\pi}{12},~\dfrac{13\pi}{12}\) and \(\dfrac{17\pi}{12}\text{.}\)</p>
