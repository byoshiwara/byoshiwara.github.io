<p>One way to specify a location is to give a direction and a distance from a fixed landmark.  For example, we might say that the airport is located 8 miles northeast of the town hall, or that a ship has been sighted 20 miles from the lighthouse in the direction 10Â° west of north. It's not enough to give just the distance to the object or just the direction; we need both to describe the object's location.</p>
