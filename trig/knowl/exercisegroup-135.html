<p>At a ski slope, the lift chairs take 5 minutes to travel from the bottom, at an elevation of 3000 feet, to the top, at elevation 4000 feet.  The cable supporting the ski lift chairs is a loop turning on pulleys at a constant speed.  At the top and bottom, the chairs are at a constant elevation for a few seconds to allow skiers to get on and off.</p>
