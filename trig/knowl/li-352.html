<p>A recipe for coffee cake calls for \(\dfrac{3}{4}\) cup of sugar and \(1\dfrac{3}{4}\) cup of flour.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>What is the ratio of sugar to flour?  Write your answer as a common fraction, and then give a decimal approximation rounded to four places.</p>
<p>For parts (b) and (c) below, write an equation that you can solve to answer the question.  Use the ratio \(\dfrac{\text{Amount of sugar}}{\text{Amount of flour}}\)in your equation.</p>
</li>
<li>How much sugar should you use if you use 4 cups of flour?  Compute your answer two ways:  writing the ratio as a common fraction, and then writing the ratio as a decimal approximation.  Are your answers the same?</li>
