<p>A radio tower is 40 miles from an airport, in the direction of \(23\degree\) east of north. Maria flies due north from the airport, and after 12 minutes, she sees the radio tower in the direction \(37\degree\) east of north. How far has she traveled, and what is her average ground speed?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">42<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
