<p>A rock climber estimates the height of a cliff she plans to scale as follows. She places a mirror on the ground so that she can just see the top of the cliff in the mirror while she stands straight.</p>

She then measures the distance to the mirror (2 feet) and the distance from the mirror to the base of the cliff (56 feet).  If she is 5 feet 6 inches tall, how high is the cliff?</p></div>

<p>Edo estimates the height of the Washington Monument as follows.  He notices that he can see the reflection of the top of the monument in the reflecting pool.  He is  feet from the tip of the reflection, and that point is 1080 yards from the base of the monument, as shown below.  From his physics class Edo knows that the angles marked and are equal.  If Edo is 6 feet tall, what is his estimate for the height of the Washington Monument?</p>

<p>In the sixth century BC, the Greek philosopher and mathematician Thales used similar triangles to measure the distance to a ship at sea.  Two observers on the shore at points \(A\) and \(B\) would sight the ship and measure the angles formed, as shown in figure (a).  They would then construct a similar triangle as shown in figure (b), with the same angles at \(A\) and \(B\text{,}\) and measure its sides.  (This method is called <em class="emphasis">triangulation</em>.)  Use the lengths given in the figures to find the distance from observer  to the ship.</p>

<p>The Capilano Suspension Bridge is a footbridge that spans a 230-foot gorge north of Vancouver, British Columbia.  Before crossing the bridge, you decide to estimate its length.</p>

<div class="sbspanel" style="width:61.0526315789474%;justify-content:flex-start;"><p>You walk 100 feet downstream from the bridge and sight its far end, noting the angle formed by your line of sight, as shown in figure (a).  You then construct a similar right triangle with a two-centimeter base, as shown in figure (b).  You find that the height of your triangle is 8.98 centimeters.  How long is the Capilano Suspension Bridge?</p></div>
