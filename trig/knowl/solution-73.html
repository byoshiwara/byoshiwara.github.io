<div class="para">Figure (a) is not the graph of a function at all: It does not pass the vertical line test. That is, some values of <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> such as <span class="process-math">\(t = 0\text{,}\)</span> correspond to more than one value of <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> which is not possible in the graph of a function.</div> <div class="para">Figure (b) shows the height of the minute hand varying between a maximum and minimum value. The height decreases at a constant rate (the graph is straight and the slope is constant) until the minimum is reached, and then increases at a constant rate.</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:60%;"><div class="para">But notice that during the 10 minutes from 12:10 to 12:20 the height of the minute hand decreases about half the diameter of the clock, while from 12:20 to 12:30 the height decreases only about a quarter of the diameter of the clock, as shown at right.</div></div>

</div></div> <div class="para">Thus the height of the minute hand does not decrease at a constant rate.</div> <div class="para">Figure (c) is the best choice. The graph is curved because the slopes are not constant. The graph is steep when the height is changing rapidly, and the graph is nearly horizontal when the height is changing slowly. The height changes slowly near the hour and the half-hour, and more rapidly near the quarter-hours.</div>
