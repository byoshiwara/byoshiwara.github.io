<div class="para">Bob is flying to Monterey but must change course to avoid a storm. He flies <span class="process-math">\(19\degree\)</span> off from his original direction until he clears the storm, then turns again to return back to his original flight path, intercepting it at an angle of <span class="process-math">\(54.9\degree\)</span> and at a distance of 50 miles from where he had left it. How much farther did his detour require compared with his original course?</div>
