<p>Delbert has gone sailing with friends. After leaving the marina, they sail for 5 miles on a bearing of \(160\degree\) and stop at Gull Island for lunch. (Recall that bearings are measured clockwise from north.) After lunch, they have sailed for 3 miles on a bearing of \(25\degree\) when they get a phone call to return home. What bearing is the most direct route back to the marina, and how far is it?</p>
