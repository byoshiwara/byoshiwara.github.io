<div class="para">It is often useful to describe a vector by giving its horizontal and vertical components, instead of its magnitude and direction. To make the notation easier, we give names to the vectors of length 1 that point in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-directions. A vector of magnitude 1 is called a <dfn class="terminology">unit vector</dfn>. We can have unit vectors in any direction, but the unit vector in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-direction is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\bf{i}\text{,}\)</span> and the unit vector in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-direction is called <span class="process-math">\(\bf{j}\text{,}\)</span> as shown below.</div>
