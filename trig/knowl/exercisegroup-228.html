<p>The largest clock ever constructed was the Floral Clock in the garden of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. The hour hand was 50 feet long, the minute hand was 75 feet long, and the radius of the clockface was 112 feet.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>If you started at the 12 and walked 500 feet clockwise around the clockface, through how many radians would you walk?</li>
<li>If you started your walk at noon, how long would it take the minute hand to reach your position?  How far did the tip of the minute hand move in its arc?</li>

<p>In 1851 Jean-Bernard Foucault demonstrated the rotation of the earth with a pendulum installed in the Pantheon in Paris.  Foucault's pendulum consisted of a cannonball suspended on a 67 meter wire, and it swept out an arc of 8 meters on each swing. Through what angle did the pendulum swing? Give your answer in radians and then in degrees, rounded to the nearest hundredth.</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">42<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>A wheel with radius 40 centimeters is rolled a distance of 1000 centimeters on a flat surface.  Through what angle has the wheel rotated? Give your answer in radians and then in degrees, rounded to one decimal place.</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">43<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>Clothes dryers draw 3.5 times as much power as washing machines, so newer machines have been engineered for greater efficiency. A vigorous spin cycle reduces the time needed for drying, and some front-loading models spin at a rate of 1500 rotations per minute.</p>

<li>If the radius of the drum is 11 inches, how far do your socks travel in one minute?</li>
<li>How fast are your socks traveling during the spin cycle?</li>

<li>How far does the telescope travel in one hour? (The radius of the earth is 6400 kilometers.)</li>

<p>The first large windmill used to generate electricity was built in Cleveland, Ohio in 1888. Its sails were 17 meters in diameter, and moved at 10 rotations per minute. How fast did the ends of the sails travel?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">46<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>The largest windmill operating today has wings 54 meters in length. To be most efficient, the tips of the wings must travel at 50 meters per second. How fast must the wings rotate?</p></article>
