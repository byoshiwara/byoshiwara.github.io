<p>Esther swam 3.6 miles heading \(20\degree\) east of north. However, the water current displaced her by 0.9 miles in the direction \(37\degree\) east of north. How far is Esther from her starting point, and in what direction?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">36</span></h6>
<p>Rani paddles her canoe 4.5 miles in the direction \(12\degree\) west of north. The water current pushes her 0.3 miles off course in the direction \(5\degree\) east of north.  How far is Rani from her starting point, and in what direction?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">37</span></h6>
<p>Brenda wants to fly to an airport that is 103 miles due west in 1 hour. The prevailing winds blow in the direction \(112\degree\) east of north at 28 miles per hour, so Brenda will head her plane somewhat north of due west to compensate. What airspeed and direction should Brenda take?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">38</span></h6>
<p>Ryan wants to cross a 300 meter wide river running due south at 80 meters per minute.  There are rocks upstream and rapids downstream, so he wants to paddle straight across from east to west. In what direction should he point his kayak, and how fast should his water speed be in order to cross the river in 2 minutes? (Hint: The current will move him 160 meters due south compared with where his speed and direction would take him if the current stopped.  Compute the distance he would have traveled, then divide by 2 minutes to get the speed.)</p></article>
