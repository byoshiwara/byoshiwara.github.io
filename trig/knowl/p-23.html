<li>A standard way to label a triangle is to call the angles \(A,~B,\) and \(C\text{.}\) The side opposite angle \(A\) is called \(a\text{,}\) the side opposite angle \(B\) is called \(b\text{,}\) and the side opposite angle \(C\) is called \(c\text{.}\) Sketch a triangle and label it with standard notation.</li>
<li>Using a ruler, carefully draw a triangle and label it with standard notation so that \(a \gt b \gt c\text{.}\) Now use a protractor to measure the angles and list them in order from largest to smallest. What do you observe?</li>
<li>Using a ruler, carefully draw another triangle and label it with standard notation so that \(A \gt B \gt C\text{.}\) Now use a ruler to measure the sides and list them in order from largest to smallest. What do you observe?</li>
