<div class="para">Now continue plotting the points in the table as <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> increases from <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{.}\)</span> In the second quadrant, <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> decreases as <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> increases, as shown in figure (b). The graph we obtain is, in fact, a circle, which we will prove algebraically shortly. However, we have not yet plotted points for <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2\pi\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(\sin \theta\)</span> is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, all the <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span>-values for these angles are negative.</div>
