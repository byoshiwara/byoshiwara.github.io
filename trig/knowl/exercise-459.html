<div class="para">A baseball diamond is a square with sides 90 feet long. The corners are called (in clockwise order) first base, second base, third base, and home plate. The sides are called baselines. A runner is on the baseline between first and second base, 20 feet from second base. How far is the runner from home plate? What is the angle between the baseline from home plate to first base and the line from home plate to the runner?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap2-summary.html#exercise-459" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
