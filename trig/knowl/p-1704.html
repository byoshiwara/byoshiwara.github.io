<li>Use a protractor to draw an angle of \(56\degree\) in standard position. Draw its reference triangle.</li>
<li>Use your calculator to find the sine and cosine of \(56\degree\text{,}\) rounded to two decimal places. Label the sides of the reference triangle with their lengths.</li>
<li>What are the coordinates of the point \(P\) where your angle intersects the unit circle?</li>
<li>Draw the reflection of your reference triangle across the \(y\)-axis, so that you have a congruent triangle in the second quadrant.</li>
<li>You now have the reference triangle for a second-quadrant angle in standard position. What is that angle?</li>
<li>Use your calculator to find the sine and cosine of your new angle.  Label the coordinates of the point \(Q\) where the angle intersects the unit circle.</li>
<li>Draw the reflection of your triangle from part (4) across the \(x\)-axis, so that you have a congruent triangle in the third quadrant.</li>
<li>You now have the reference triangle for a third-quadrant angle in standard position. What is that angle?</li>
<li>Use your calculator to find the sine and cosine of your new angle. Label the coordinates of the point \(R\) where the angle intersects the unit circle.</li>
<li>Draw the reflection of your triangle from part (7) across the \(y\)-axis, so that you have a congruent triangle in the fourth quadrant.</li>
<li>You now have the reference triangle for a fourth-quadrant angle in standard position. What is that angle?</li>
<li>Use your calculator to find the sine and cosine of your new angle.  Label the coordinates of the point where the angle intersects the unit circle.</li>
