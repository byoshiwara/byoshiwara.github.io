<p>Now continue plotting the points in the table as \(\theta\) increases from \(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\pi\text{.}\) In the second quadrant, \(r\) decreases as \(\theta\) increases, as shown in figure (b). The graph we obtain is, in fact, a circle, which we will prove algebraically shortly. However, we have not yet plotted points for \(\theta\) between \(0\) and \(2\pi\text{.}\) Because \(\sin \theta\) is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, all the \(r\)-values for these angles are negative.</p>
