<p>A radio tower is 40 miles from an airport, in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(23\degree\)</span> east of north. Maria flies due north from the airport, and after 12 minutes, she sees the radio tower in the direction <span class="process-math">\(37\degree\)</span> east of north. How far has she traveled, and what is her average ground speed?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">42<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>As Odysseus begins a sailing journey, an island 2 kilometers distant is in the direction <span class="process-math">\(12\degree\)</span> west of north.

<p>Evel and Carla are estimating the distance across a canyon. They stand 75 meters apart and each site a larger boulder on the opposite side. Evel measures an angle of <span class="process-math">\(82\degree\)</span> from Carla to the boulder, and Carla measures an angle of <span class="process-math">\(74\degree\)</span> from Evel to the boulder.  How far is Evel from the boulder?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">45<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>A blimp is flying in a straight line towards a football stadium. Giselle and Hakim have homes 520 meters apart, both directly below the blimp's path. At a moment when the blimp is between them, Giselle measures an angle of elevation to the blimp to be <span class="process-math">\(38\degree\text{,}\)</span> and Hakim measures the angle of elevation to be <span class="process-math">\(42\degree\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p>A model plane flying in a straight line passes directly over both first Adi's and then Bettina's head. Adi sees an angle of elevation of <span class="process-math">\(17\degree\)</span> to the plane and Bettina sees an angle of elevation of <span class="process-math">\(58\degree\text{.}\)</span> Adi and Bettina are 150 meters apart, and Bettina is between Adi and the plane.</p>
