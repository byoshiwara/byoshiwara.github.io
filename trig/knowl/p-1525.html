Chesterfield and Alton are 7 miles apart. Fabrick Rock has a plaque that shows directions to famous sites, and from the plaque Ann determines that the angle between the lines to the spire and the phone box measures <span class="process-math">\(19\degree\text{.}\)</span> How far is Fabrick Rock from the phone box? (There are two possible answers.)</div>
