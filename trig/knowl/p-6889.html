<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Although square roots of negative numbers such as are not real numbers, they occur often in mathematics and its applications. Mathematicians began working with square roots of negative numbers in the sixteenth century, in their attempts to solve quadratic and cubic equations. Ren√© Descartes gave them the name <dfn class="terminology">imaginary numbers</dfn>, which reflected the mistrust with which mathematicians regarded them at the time. Today, however, such numbers are well understood and used routinely by scientists and engineers.</p>
