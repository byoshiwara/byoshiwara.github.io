<p>Using simple mathematical models, researchers can estimate the degree to which the center of the storm becomes vertically tilted, based on the cloudiness within the eyewall and the structure of the wind outside the eyewall. By modeling the development of storm tilt, a better understanding of a tropical cyclone's behavior is gained in the presence and absence of wind shear.  In particular, an El Ni√±o weather system creates changes in the jet stream over the Northern Hemisphere, resultingin decreased wind shear in the Pacific and increased wind shear across much of the Atlantic basin, which suppresses hurricane activity.</p>
