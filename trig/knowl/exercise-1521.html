<p>The largest clock ever constructed was the Floral Clock in the garden of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. The hour hand was 50 feet long, the minute hand was 75 feet long, and the radius of the clockface was 112 feet.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>If you started at the 12 and walked 500 feet clockwise around the clockface, through how many radians would you walk?</li>
<li>If you started your walk at noon, how long would it take the minute hand to reach your position?  How far did the tip of the minute hand move in its arc?</li>
