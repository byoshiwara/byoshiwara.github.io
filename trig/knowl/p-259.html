<p>Edo estimates the height of the Washington Monument as follows.  He notices that he can see the reflection of the top of the monument in the reflecting pool.  He is  feet from the tip of the reflection, and that point is 1080 yards from the base of the monument, as shown below.  From his physics class Edo knows that the angles marked and are equal.  If Edo is 6 feet tall, what is his estimate for the height of the Washington Monument?</p>
