<p>In the sixth century BC, the Greek philosopher and mathematician Thales used similar triangles to measure the distance to a ship at sea.  Two observers on the shore at points \(A\) and \(B\) would sight the ship and measure the angles formed, as shown in figure (a).  They would then construct a similar triangle as shown in figure (b), with the same angles at \(A\) and \(B\text{,}\) and measure its sides.  (This method is called <em class="emphasis">triangulation</em>.)  Use the lengths given in the figures to find the distance from observer  to the ship.</p>
