<p>In addition to the Homework Problems, each Example in the book is followed by a similar Exercise for students to test their understanding.  Each Section concludes with a Summary , a set of Study Questions, and a list of Skills to be addressed in the Homework.  A Summary and a set of Review Problems follows each chapter.  Chapters 1 through 8 include Activities for students to work through some of the main ideas.
