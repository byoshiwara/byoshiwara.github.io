<p>Hurricane researchers know that strong vertical wind shear is a major factor affecting potential hurricane development.  Wind shear is the variation of the wind's speed or direction over a short distance within the atmosphere.  If there is too much wind, a storm has trouble developing into a cyclone. With little or no wind shear, the turning within the tropical system becomes vertically aligned, helping to keep it intact.  Thus, the most favorable condition for tropical cyclone development is the absence of wind shear.</p>
