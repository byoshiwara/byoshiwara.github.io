<p>Unless \(\bf{u}\) and \(\bf{v}\) are parallel vectors, it is not true that the length of \(\bf{u} + \bf{v}\) is just the sum of the lengths of \(\bf{u}\) and \(\bf{v}\text{.}\) Vector addition is a geometric operation; the length of \(\bf{u} + \bf{v}\) depends on the lengths of \(\bf{u}\) and \(\bf{v}\) and on the angle between them.  Be careful to distinguish between regular addition of scalars, such as \(\|{\bf{u}}\| + \|{\bf{v}}\|\text{,}\) and vector addition, \(\bf{u} + \bf{v}\text{,}\) which requires the parallelogram rule.</p>
