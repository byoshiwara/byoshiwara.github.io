<div class="para">For example, imagine a beetle walking across a moving conveyor belt, as shown in figure (a) below.  The conveyor belt is moving at a speed of 4 inches per second, and the beetle walks at right angles to the motion of the belt at 2 inches per second.  After 1 second, the beetle has traveled from his starting point at <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to point <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> distance of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20}\text{,}\)</span> or about 4.47 inches. His actual velocity relative to the ground is 4.47 inches per second at an angle of <span class="process-math">\(\theta = \tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{4}) = 26.6\degree\)</span> from the direction of the conveyor belt.</div>
