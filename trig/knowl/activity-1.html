</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Materials:  You will need paper and pencil, scissors, a ruler and compass, and two plastic straws.</p>
<p>Prepare:  Cut the straw into pieces of lengths 2 inches, 3 inches, and 6 inches. Use the ruler to draw a large triangle, and cut it out.</p>

<p>What do we know about the sides of a triangle?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Can you make a triangle with sides of length 2 inches, 3 inches, and 6 inches?</li>
<li>Use the pieces of length 2 inches and 3 inches to form two sides of a triangle. What happens to the length of the third side as you increase the angle between the first two sides?</li>
<li>What is the longest that the third side could be? What is the smallest?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Two sides of a triangle are 6 centimeters and 8 centimeters long. What are the possible lengths of the third side?</li>
<li>Two sides of a triangle are \(p\) units and \(q\) units long. What are the possible lengths of the third side?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do we know about the angles of a triangle?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Use a protractor to measure the three angles of the paper triangle in degrees. Now add up the three angles. What is their sum?</li>
<li>Tear off the three corners of the triangle. Place them side-by-side with their vertices (tips) at the same point. What do you find?</li>
<li>How are your answers to parts (1) and (2) related?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are the sides and angles of a triangle related?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>A standard way to label a triangle is to call the angles \(A,~B,\) and \(C\text{.}\) The side opposite angle \(A\) is called \(a\text{,}\) the side opposite angle \(B\) is called \(b\text{,}\) and the side opposite angle \(C\) is called \(c\text{.}\) Sketch a triangle and label it with standard notation.</li>
<li>Using a ruler, carefully draw a triangle and label it with standard notation so that \(a \gt b \gt c\text{.}\) Now use a protractor to measure the angles and list them in order from largest to smallest. What do you observe?</li>
<li>Using a ruler, carefully draw another triangle and label it with standard notation so that \(A \gt B \gt C\text{.}\) Now use a ruler to measure the sides and list them in order from largest to smallest. What do you observe?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do we know about right triangles?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The side opposite the \(90\degree\) angle in a right triangle is called the <dfn class="terminology">hypotenuse</dfn>. Why is the hypotenuse always the longest side of a right triangle?</li>
<li>
<p>The Pythagorean theorem states that:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\text{IF}:~~ 	a,~b,~ \text{and}~c~ \text{are the sides of a right triangle, and}~c~ \text{is the hypotenuse,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\text{THEN}:~~a^2 + b^2 = c^2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The "if" part of the theorem is called the <dfn class="terminology">hypothesis</dfn>, and the "then" part is called the <dfn class="terminology">conclusion</dfn>.  The <dfn class="terminology">converse</dfn> of a theorem is the new statement you obtain when you interchange the hypothesis and the conclusion.  Write the converse of the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The converse of the Pythagorean theorem is also true. Use the converse to decide whether each of the following triangles is a right triangle. Support your conclusions with calculations. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha cols2">
<li>\(a = 9,~ b = 16,~ c = 25\)</li>
<li>\(a = 12,~ b = 16,~ c = 20\)</li>
<li>\(a = \sqrt{8},~ b = \sqrt{5},~ c = \sqrt{13}\)</li>
<li>\(a = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2},~ b = \dfrac{1}{2},~ c = 1\)</li>
