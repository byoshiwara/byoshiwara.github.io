</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Materials:  You will need paper and pencil, scissors, a ruler and compass, and two plastic straws.</p>
<p>Prepare:  Cut the straw into pieces of lengths 2 inches, 3 inches, and 6 inches. Use the ruler to draw a large triangle, and cut it out.</p>

<p>What do we know about the sides of a triangle?</p>

<li><p>Can you make a triangle with sides of length 2 inches, 3 inches, and 6 inches?</p></li>
<li><p>Use the pieces of length 2 inches and 3 inches to form two sides of a triangle. What happens to the length of the third side as you increase the angle between the first two sides?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the longest that the third side could be? What is the smallest?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Two sides of a triangle are 6 centimeters and 8 centimeters long. What are the possible lengths of the third side?</p></li>
<li><p>Two sides of a triangle are <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> units and <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> units long. What are the possible lengths of the third side?</p></li>

<li>
<p>What do we know about the angles of a triangle?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Use a protractor to measure the three angles of the paper triangle in degrees. Now add up the three angles. What is their sum?</p></li>
<li><p>Tear off the three corners of the triangle. Place them side-by-side with their vertices (tips) at the same point. What do you find?</p></li>
<li><p>How are your answers to parts (1) and (2) related?</p></li>

<p>How are the sides and angles of a triangle related?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>A standard way to label a triangle is to call the angles <span class="process-math">\(A,~B,\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> The side opposite angle <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is called <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> the side opposite angle <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is called <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and the side opposite angle <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is called <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> Sketch a triangle and label it with standard notation.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a ruler, carefully draw a triangle and label it with standard notation so that <span class="process-math">\(a \gt b \gt c\text{.}\)</span> Now use a protractor to measure the angles and list them in order from largest to smallest. What do you observe?</p></li>
<li><p>Using a ruler, carefully draw another triangle and label it with standard notation so that <span class="process-math">\(A \gt B \gt C\text{.}\)</span> Now use a ruler to measure the sides and list them in order from largest to smallest. What do you observe?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do we know about right triangles?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The side opposite the <span class="process-math">\(90\degree\)</span> angle in a right triangle is called the <dfn class="terminology">hypotenuse</dfn>. Why is the hypotenuse always the longest side of a right triangle?</p></li>
<li><p>The Pythagorean theorem states that: <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;"><div class="sbspanel fixed-width top" style="width:100%;"><table class="tabular">
<tr>
<td class="l t b0 r0 l0 t0" style="max-width:90px;"><p>IF:</p></td>
<td class="l t b0 r0 l0 t0" style="max-width:480px;"><p><span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> are the sides of a right triangle, and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the hypotenuse</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="l t b0 r0 l0 t0" style="max-width:90px;"><p>THEN: <span class="process-math">\(\qquad\)</span></p></td>
<td class="l t b0 r0 l0 t0 lines"><span class="process-math">\(a^2+b^2=c^2\)</span></td>
</tr>
</table></div></div></div> The "if" part of the theorem is called the <dfn class="terminology">hypothesis</dfn>, and the "then" part is called the <dfn class="terminology">conclusion</dfn>.  The <dfn class="terminology">converse</dfn> of a theorem is the new statement you obtain when you interchange the hypothesis and the conclusion.  Write the converse of the Pythagorean theorem.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The converse of the Pythagorean theorem is also true. Use the converse to decide whether each of the following triangles is a right triangle. Support your conclusions with calculations.</p>
