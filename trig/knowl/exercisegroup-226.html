<p>The largest clock ever constructed was the Floral Clock in the garden of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. The hour hand was 50 feet long, the minute hand was 75 feet long, and the radius of the clockface was 112 feet.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>If you started at the 12 and walked 500 feet clockwise around the clockface, through how many radians would you walk?</li>
<li>If you started your walk at noon, how long would it take the minute hand to reach your position?  How far did the tip of the minute hand move in its arc?</li>

<p>In 1851 Jean-Bernard Foucault demonstrated the rotation of the earth with a pendulum installed in the Pantheon in Paris.  Foucault's pendulum consisted of a cannonball suspended on a 67 meter wire, and it swept out an arc of 8 meters on each swing. Through what angle did the pendulum swing? Give your answer in radians and then in degrees, rounded to the nearest hundredth.</p>

<p>Clothes dryers draw 3.5 times as much power as washing machines, so newer machines have been engineered for greater efficiency. A vigorous spin cycle reduces the time needed for drying, and some front-loading models spin at a rate of 1500 rotations per minute.</p>
