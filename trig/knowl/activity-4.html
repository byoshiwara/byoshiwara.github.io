<ul class="disc"><li><p>Materials: You will need paper and pencil, a ruler, compass, and protractor, or a dynamic geometry program such as Geogebra.</p></li></ul>
<ol class="upper-alpha">
<li>
<p>The vertices of a triangle determine a unique circumscribing circle.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Draw a large acute triangle and label the vertices <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> , <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Draw the perpendicular bisector of side <span class="process-math">\(\overline{AC}\text{.}\)</span> You can use a compass, or use your ruler and protractor as follows:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find the midpoint, <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> of side <span class="process-math">\(AC\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Draw a line that passes through <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> and is perpendicular to side <span class="process-math">\(\overline{AC}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Draw the perpendicular bisector of side <span class="process-math">\(\overline{BC}\)</span> . Label the point where the two perpendicular bisectors meet with the letter <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>From geometry, we know that every point on the perpendicular bisector of a segment <span class="process-math">\(\overline{PQ}\)</span> is equidistant between <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> Use this fact to explain why the point <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is the same distance from each vertex of your triangle.</p></li>

<div class="sbspanel middle" style="width:57.8947368421053%;"><p>Using the point at <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> as the center, draw the circle that passes through all three vertices of your triangle. The circle is called the <dfn class="terminology">circumscribing circle</dfn> of the triangle.</p></div>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can move a vertex around the circle without changing the measure of its angle.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Measure angle <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> in your triangle. We say that this angle <dfn class="terminology">subtends</dfn> the arc joining <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> on the circle.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose any other point on the circle that is <em class="emphasis">not</em> on the arc <span class="process-math">\(\overset{\large\frown}{AB}\text{.}\)</span> Call this point <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> Draw the line segments <span class="process-math">\(\overline{AD}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\overline{BD}\)</span> to create a second triangle. Measure the angle at <span class="process-math">\(D\text{;}\)</span> it should be the same as the angle <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>In fact, all angles with vertex on the circle that subtend the same arc have the same measure. Verify this fact by creating two more angles that subtend the arc <span class="process-math">\(\overset{\large\frown}{AB}\text{.}\)</span></p>

<li>
<p>What is the length of the diameter of the circumscribing circle?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>At this point, if your drawing is too cluttered, you may need to make a fresh copy of the circumscribing circle. On this circle draw just the side <span class="process-math">\(\overline{AB}\)</span> from your original triangle.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw the diameter that passes through <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> (remember that <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is the center of the circle), and label the other end of the diameter with the letter <span class="process-math">\(C'\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Draw triangle <span class="process-math">\(\Delta ABC'\text{,}\)</span> and measure the angle at <span class="process-math">\(C'\text{.}\)</span> It should be the same as angle <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> in your original triangle. (Why?) Let's call this angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Now measure angle <span class="process-math">\(\angle BAC'\text{.}\)</span> It should be 90 degrees, This is another fact from geometry: Any angle that intercepts the diameter of a circle is a right angle. Put a right angle symbol at angle <span class="process-math">\(\angle BAC'\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Label the length of the sides of your triangle as follows:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Side <span class="process-math">\(\overline{BC'}\)</span> has length <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> (for diameter)</p></li>
<li><p>Side <span class="process-math">\(\overline{AC'}\)</span> has length <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Side <span class="process-math">\(\overline{AB}\)</span> has length <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">(Notice that <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the side opposite the angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span>). Using the letters <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> as needed, finish the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\sin\theta =\hphantom{000000000000000}
\end{equation*}

</li>
<li><p>Start from the last equation, and solve for <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(\sin C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equating expressions for the diameter: The Law of Sines</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>You have now written an expression for the diameter of the circumscribing circle in terms of angle <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and its opposite side. If you start the derivation with angle <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and the arc <span class="process-math">\(\overset{\large\frown}{AC}\text{,}\)</span> you will get another expression for the diameter. Write that expression here.</p></li>
<li><p>Now write an expression for the diameter that results from starting with angle <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and arc <span class="process-math">\(\overset{\large\frown}{BC}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Write an equation that reflects the fact that the diameter of the circle has the same length in all three expressions.</p>
<p>This is the Law of Sines! All three expressions represent the diameter of the circumscribing circle, so they are equal to each other.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification for right and obtuse triangles</p>
<p>If ABC is not an acute triangle, then one of the angles must either be a right angle or an obtuse angle.</p>
<ul class="disc"><li><p>In a right triangle, call the right angle <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Now you are already at step (4) of part C , so the derivation continues as before.</p></li></ul>
<p>To see the derivation for an obtuse triangle, follow the steps:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Draw a circle and a triangle with vertices <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> on the circle so that there is an obtuse angle at point <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Measure the angle at <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> and note that the larger arc <span class="process-math">\(\overset{\large\frown}{AB}\)</span> subtended by <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> is more than half of the circle.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a point <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> on the larger arc <span class="process-math">\(\overset{\large\frown}{AB}\text{.}\)</span> In triangle <span class="process-math">\(\Delta ABD\text{,}\)</span> the angle at <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> subtends the shorter arc connecting <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Measure the angle at <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> You should find that the angles at <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> are supplementary.</p></li>
<li><p>Here is another fact from geometry: The measure of an inscribed angle in a circle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Use this fact to explain why the angles at <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> are supplementary.</p></li>
<li>
<p>What can you say about the sines of angles <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\text{?}\)</span> Because it is an acute triangle, we can use our original derivation on <span class="process-math">\(\Delta ABD\text{,}\)</span> and substitute <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> in the result.</p>
