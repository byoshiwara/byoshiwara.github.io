<div class="para">In 1855 Lissajous invented a pair of tuning forks designed to visualize sound vibrations. Each tuning fork had a small mirror mounted at the end of one prong, and a light beam reflected from one mirror to the other was projected onto a screen, producing a Lissajous figure. Stable patterns appear only when the two forks vibrate at frequencies in simple ratios, such as 2:1 or 3:2, which correspond to the musical intervals of the octave and perfect fifth. So, by observing the Lissajous figures, people were able to make tuning adjustments more accurately than they could do by ear.</div>
