<p>To find the distance across a ravine, Delbert takes some measurements from a small airplane. When he is a short distance from the ravine at an altitude of 500 feet, he finds that the angle of depression to the near side of the ravine is \(56\degree\text{,}\) and the angle of depression to the far side is \(32\degree\text{.}\) What is the width of the ravine?  (Hint:  First find the horizontal distance from Delbert to the near side of the ravine.)</p>
