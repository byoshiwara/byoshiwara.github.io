<p>It is often useful to describe a vector by giving its horizontal and vertical components, instead of its magnitude and direction. To make the notation easier, we give names to the vectors of length 1 that point in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions. A vector of magnitude 1 is called a <dfn class="terminology">unit vector</dfn>. We can have unit vectors in any direction, but the unit vector in the \(x\)-direction is denoted by \(\bf{i}\text{,}\) and the unit vector in the \(y\)-direction is called \(\bf{j}\text{,}\) as shown below.</p>
