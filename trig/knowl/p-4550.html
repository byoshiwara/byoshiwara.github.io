<p>Thus, velocity is a vector quantity, and we can calculate the result of two simultaneous motions by using the parallelogram rule. We treat the two motions as if they had occurred one after the other, by starting one vector at the endpoint of the other. (Remember we can move a vector from one location to another, as long as we preserve its length and direction.)</p>
