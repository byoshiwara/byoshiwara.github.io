<p>If you have a baseball cap, here is another way to measure the distance across a river.  Stand at point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> directly across the river from a convenient landmark, say a large rock, on the other side.  Tilt your head down so that the brim of the cap points directly at the base of the rock, <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Draw a figure showing the river, the rock, and right triangle <span class="process-math">\(ABR\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is the location of your baseball cap on your head.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, without changing the angle of your head, rotate <span class="process-math">\(90\degree\)</span> and sight along the bank on your side of the river.  Have a friend mark the spot <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> on the ground where the brim of your cap points.  Add triangle <span class="process-math">\(ABC\)</span> to your figure.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you can measure the distance from point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to point <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span>  Explain why this distance is the same as the distance across the river.</p></li>
