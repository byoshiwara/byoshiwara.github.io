<li><p>Meanwhile Francine, who was still standing at point <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> walks away from the stream at right-angles to Delbert's path.   Delbert watches her progress, and tells her to stop at point <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> when the angle between the stream bank and his line of sight to Francine is the same as the angle from the stream bank to the tree.  Add triangle <span class="process-math">\(ABC\)</span> to your figure.</p></li>
