<p>The typical trigonometry student has just completed a second course in algebra.  He or she has a nodding acquaintance with functions and is still very wary of irrational numbers.  A statement such as  "\(\sin \dfrac{5\pi}{3} = \dfrac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}\)" may well be greeted with panic and bewilderment. So we do not begin with a preliminary chapter covering all the mathematical topics needed for the rest of the course, including elements of analytic geometry and properties of functions such as domain and range, symmetry, transformations, composition, and inverse functions.  (This material usually comprises most of a precalculus course, which is usually taught after trigonometry, where it is introduced using more familiar, hence easier, functions as examples.)</p>
