<p>Megan rows her kayak due east. When she began, she spotted a lighthouse 2000 meters in the distance at an angle of \(14\degree\) south of east. After traveling for of an hour, the lighthouse was at an angle of \(83\degree\) south of east. How far did Megan travel, and what was her average speed?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">23<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>Chad is hiking along a straight path but needs to detour around a large pond. He turns \(23\degree\) from his path until clear of the pond, then walks back to his original path, intercepting it at an angle of \(29\degree\) and at a distance of 2 miles from where he had left the path. How far did Chad walk in each of the two segments of his detour, and how much farther did his detour require compared with a straight line through the pond?</p>

<p>Geologists find an outcropping from an underground rock formation that normally indicates the presence of oil. The outcropping is on a hillside, and the formation itself dips another \(17\degree\) from the surface. If an oil well is placed 1000 meters downhill from the outcropping, how far will the well have to drill before it reaches the formation?</p>
