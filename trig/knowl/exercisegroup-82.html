<p>Maryam wants to know the height of a cliff on the other side of a ravine. The angle of elevation from her edge of the ravine to the cliff top is <span class="process-math">\(84.6\degree\text{.}\)</span> When she moves 30 feet back from the ravine, the angle of elevation is <span class="process-math">\(82.5\degree\text{.}\)</span> How tall is the cliff?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">20<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Amir wants to know the height of a tree in the median strip of a highway. The angle of elevation from the highway shoulder to the treetop is <span class="process-math">\(43.5\degree\text{.}\)</span> When he moves 10 feet farther away from the tree, the angle of elevation is <span class="process-math">\(37.2\degree\)</span>  How tall is the tree?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">21<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Delbert and Francine are 10 kilometers apart, both observing a satellite that passes directly over their heads. At a moment when the satellite is between them, Francine measures its angle of elevation as <span class="process-math">\(84.6\degree\text{,}\)</span> and Delbert measures an angle of <span class="process-math">\(87\degree\text{.}\)</span> How far is the satellite from Delbert?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">22<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Megan rows her kayak due east. When she began, she spotted a lighthouse 2000 meters in the distance at an angle of <span class="process-math">\(14\degree\)</span> south of east. After traveling for of an hour, the lighthouse was at an angle of <span class="process-math">\(83\degree\)</span> south of east. How far did Megan travel, and what was her average speed?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">23<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<p>Chad is hiking along a straight path but needs to detour around a large pond. He turns <span class="process-math">\(23\degree\)</span> from his path until clear of the pond, then walks back to his original path, intercepting it at an angle of <span class="process-math">\(29\degree\)</span> and at a distance of 2 miles from where he had left the path. How far did Chad walk in each of the two segments of his detour, and how much farther did his detour require compared with a straight line through the pond?</p>

<p>Geologists find an outcropping from an underground rock formation that normally indicates the presence of oil. The outcropping is on a hillside, and the formation itself dips another <span class="process-math">\(17\degree\)</span> from the surface. If an oil well is placed 1000 meters downhill from the outcropping, how far will the well have to drill before it reaches the formation?</p>

<p>Thelma wants to measure the height of a hill. She first plants a 50 foot tall antenna at the hill's peak. Then she descends the hill and finds a point where she can see the top and the bottom of the antenna.
