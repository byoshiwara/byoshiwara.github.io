<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Ryan wants to cross a 300 meter wide river running due south at 80 meters per minute.  There are rocks upstream and rapids downstream, so he wants to paddle straight across from east to west. In what direction should he point his kayak, and how fast should his water speed be in order to cross the river in 2 minutes? (Hint: The current will move him 160 meters due south compared with where his speed and direction would take him if the current stopped.  Compute the distance he would have traveled, then divide by 2 minutes to get the speed.)</p>
