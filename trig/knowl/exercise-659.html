<p>From the lookout point on Fabrick Rock, Ann can see not only see the famous "Crooked Spire" in Chesterfield, which is 8 miles away, but also the red phone box in the village of Alton. Chesterfield and Alton are 7 miles apart. Fabrick Rock has a plaque that shows directions to famous sites, and from the plaque Ann determines that the angle between the lines to the spire and the phone box measures \(19\degree\text{.}\) How far is Fabrick Rock from the the phone box? (There are two possible answers.)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="The-Law-of-Sines.html#exercise-659">in-context</a></span>
