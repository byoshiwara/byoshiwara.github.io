<p>Delbert and Francine want to measure the distance across a stream.  They mark point \(A\) directly across the stream from a tree at point \(T\) on the opposite bank.  Delbert walks from point \(A\) down the bank a short distance to point \(B\) and sights the tree.  He measures the angle between his line of sight and the streambank.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Draw a figure showing the stream, the tree, and right triangle \(ABT\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Meanwhile Francine, who was still standing at point \(A\text{,}\) walks away from the stream at right-angles to Delbert's path.   Delbert watches her progress, and tells her to stop at point \(C\) when the angle between the stream bank and his line of sight to Francine is the same as the angle from the stream bank to the tree.  Add triangle \(ABC\) to your figure.</li>
<li>Delbert now measures the distance from point \(A\) to Francine at point \(C\text{.}\) Explain why this distance is the same as the distance across the stream.</li>
