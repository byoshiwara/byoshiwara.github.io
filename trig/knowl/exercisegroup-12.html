He is  feet from the tip of the reflection, and that point is 1080 yards from the base of the monument, as shown below.  From his physics class Edo knows that the angles marked and are equal.

<div class="para">In the sixth century BC, the Greek philosopher and mathematician Thales used similar triangles to measure the distance to a ship at sea.  Two observers on the shore at points <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> would sight the ship and measure the angles formed, as shown in figure (a).  They would then construct a similar triangle as shown in figure (b), with the same angles at <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and measure its sides.  (This method is called <em class="emphasis">triangulation</em>.)
