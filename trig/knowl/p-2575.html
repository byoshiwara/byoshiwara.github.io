<p>The apparent magnitude of a star is a measure of its brightness as seen from earth.  Smaller values of apparent magnitude correspond to brighter stars.  The graph below, called a light curve, shows the apparent magnitude of the star Algol as a function of time.  Algol is actually a system of two stars, a bright principal star and its dimmer companion, in orbit around each other.  As each star passes in front of the other it eclipses some of the light that reaches earth.</p>
