<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Florence wants to create a piechart (or circle graph) to display how much of her hospital's budget is dedicated to nurses. She finds that in the hospital's annual expenses of $60 million, the nurses' salaries and benefits totaled $1,200,000.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>What fraction of the total annual costs comes from the nurses' salaries and benefits?</li>
<li>Suppose that the entire budget is represented by the area of a circle. If the costs for the nurses are to be represented by a sector of that circle, what will be the angle of that sector?</li>
<li>If the circle has a radius of 20 centimeters, what are the areas of the circle and of the sector representing the nurses? What are the circumference of the circle and the arclength of the sector?</li>
