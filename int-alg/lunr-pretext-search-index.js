  "body": " Intermediate Algebra is a textbook for students who have some acquaintance with the basic notions of variables and equations, negative numbers, and graphs, although we provide a \"Toolkit\" to help the reader refresh any skills that may have gotten a little rusty. In this book we journey farther into the subject, to explore a greater variety of topics including graphs and modeling, curve-fitting, variation, exponentials and logarithms, and the conic sections. We use technology to handle data and give some instructions for using a graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility.  We discuss functions and their applications, but not in the detail expected of a precalculus course; our intended audience includes students preparing for the many fields that may not use calculus but nonetheless require facility with quantitative reasoning. We aim to develop that facility in the context of modeling and problem solving.   Each section of the text includes Examples followed by a similar Practice Exercise that students can try for themselves in WeBWorK.  There are also \"QuickCheck\" exercises, usually multiple choice or fill in the blanks, for students to check their understanding of the concepts presented.  Homework problems come in three groups: a short Skills Warm Up that reviews prerequisite skills for the section, then Skills Practice with new skills, and finally Applications.  We have included a variety of applied problems that we hope students (and their teachers) will find interesting.  In addition, each Chapter begins with an Investigation that can be used as a group project or as a guided in-class activity.  Chapter Reviews include a Glossary and a Summary of key concepts as well as Review Problems. There is an Activity booklet available that provides an interactive lesson for each section of the text. The Activities can be completed by students in groups or with guidance from the instructor; or they can be used as support for a lecture format.  Katherine Yoshiwara  Atascadero, CA 2020  "

  "title": "Creating a Linear Model",
  "body": "Creating a Linear Model linear model   To help them understand phenomena that affect our planet, scientists study the connections between relevant variables, such as sea level. In the next investigation we consider a simpler example and look at some ways to connect the variables involved in a career choice.  Sales on Commission  Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment. He will be paid $1000 per month plus a 6% commission on his sales. The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about $8000 worth of equipment per month. To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations.  Based on the sales manager's estimate, what monthly income can Delbert expect from this job? What annual salary would that provide?  What would Delbert's monthly salary be if he sold only $5000 of equipment per month? What would his salary be if he sold $10,000 worth per month? Compute the monthly incomes for each sales totals shown in the table.    Sales  Income                           Plot your data points on a graph, using sales, , on the horizontal axis and income, , on the vertical axis, as shown in the figure. Connect the data points to show Delbert's monthly income for all possible monthly sales totals.  graph  Add two new data points to the table by reading values from your graph.  Write an algebraic expression for Delbert's monthly income, , in terms of his monthly sales, . Use the description in the problem to help you:  He will be paid: $1000 plus a 6% commission on his sales.  Income  Test your formula from part (5) to see if it gives the same results as those you recorded in the table.  Use your formula to find out what monthly sales total Delbert would need in order to have a monthly income of $2500.  Each increase of $1000 in monthly sales increases Delbert's monthly income by .  Summarize the results of your work: In your own words, describe the relationship between Delbert's monthly sales and his monthly income. Include in your discussion a description of your graph.    Tables, Graphs, and Equations  In the Investigation you studied the connection between the variables Sales and Income for a part-time job. You created a mathematical model for that situation.  Mathematical Model  A mathematical model mathematical model model is a simplified description of reality that uses mathematics to help us understand a system or process.  We can use a model to analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change. The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between the variables involved.  QuickCheck 1 What is the first step in creating a mathematical model?   Solve the equation.  Analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change.  Describe the relationships between the variables involved.  Make a table of values.   Starting from a description in words, we can represent the relationship by: a table of values  a graph, or by  an algebraic equation  Each of these mathematical tools is useful in a different way.  A table of values table of values lists specific data points with precise numerical values.  A graph graph is a visual display of the data. It is easier to spot trends and describe the overall behavior of the variables from a graph.  An algebraic equation algebraic equation equation algebraic is a compact summary of the model. It can be used to analyze the model and to make predictions.   Look back at the Investigation to see how each of these modeling tools featured in your work.  QuickCheck 2 Name three ways to represent a relationship between variables.  In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools and how each contributes to the model.  In May 2005, the city of Lyons, France, started a bicycle rental program. Over 3,000 bicycles are available at 350 computerized stations around the city. Each of the 52,000 subscribers pays an annual 5 euro fee (about $7.20) and gets a PIN to access the bicycles. The bicycles rent for 1 euro per hour and can be returned to any station.  Your community decides to set up a similar program, charging a $5 subscription fee and $3 an hour for rental. (A fraction of an hour is charged as the corresponding fraction of $3).   Make a table of values showing the cost, , of renting a bike for various lengths of time, .  Plot the points on a graph. Draw a curve through the data points.  Write an equation for in terms of .    There is an initial fee of $5, and a rental fee of $3 per hour. To find the cost, we multiply the rental time by $3 per hour, and add the result to the $5 subscription fee. For example, the cost of a one-hour bike ride is A one-hour bike ride costs $8.  We calculate the cost for the other values of and record the results in a table as shown below.     Length of rental (hours)  Cost of rental (dollars)                         Each pair of values represents a point on the graph. The first value gives the horizontal coordinate of the point, and the second value gives the vertical coordinate.  The points lie on a straight line, as shown in the figure. The line extends infinitely in only one direction, because negative values of do not make sense here.  graph  To write an equation, we let represent the cost of the rental, and we use for the number of hours:     For more help on plotting points, see Section 1.1.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Write an equation for the cost of renting a bicycle for hours if the subscription fee is $7 and the rental fee is $2.50 per hour.  Hint: Fill in the correct numbers in the equation below.     Equations for Linear Models  The equation we wrote in Example 1.1.4 , , is an example of a linear model , which describes a variable that increases or decreases at a constant rate. The cost of renting a bicycle increased at a constant rate of $3 every hour.  Linear Model linear model  A linear model linear model describes a variable that increases or decreases at a constant rate. It has the form   QuickCheck 3 What sort of variables can be described by a linear model?   Increasing variables  Variables that change at a constant rate  Variables that describe time  Variables that can be graphed   For more help on writing a linear model, see Section 1.1.1 of the Toolkit.  The connections between an equation and its graph can give us useful information about a model. In the next Example we see how to use this idea.   Use the equation you found in to answer the following questions. Then show how to find the answers by using the graph.   How much will it cost to rent a bicycle for 6 hours?  How long can you bicycle for $18.50?    We substitute into the equation to find A 6-hour bike ride will cost $23. The point on the graph in the figure represents the cost of a 6-hour bike ride. The value on the -axis at the same height as point is 23, so a 6-hour bike ride costs $23.   We substitute into the equation and solve for .  For $18.50 you can bicycle for hours. The point on the graph represents an $18.50 bike ride. The value on the -axis below point is 4.5, so $18.50 will buy a 4.5 hour bike ride.  line though points    For more help on solving linear equations, see Section 1.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 2 In the preceding Example, how long can you bicycle for $9.50?  Hint: Start by finding $9.50 on the Cost (vertical axis). Then find the point on the graph with -coordinate $9.50. Finally, find the -coordinate of that point.  1.5 hours  In , note the different algebraic techniques we used in parts (a) and (b):   In part (a) we were given a value of and we evaluated the expression  to find .  In part (b) we were given a value of and we solved the equation  to find .   QuickCheck 4 Consider the expression . Finding a value of when we know is called . Finding a value of when we know is called .  In the examples above, the graph is increasing increasing graph graph increasing as increases. In the next Example we consider a decreasing graph decreasing graph decreasing graph decreasing function graph decreasing graph decreasing decreasing function .  Leon's camper has a 20-gallon gas tank, and he gets 12 miles to the gallon. (Note that getting 12 miles to the gallon is the same as using gallon of gas per mile.)   Write an equation for the amount of gasoline, , left in Leon's tank after he has driven for miles.  Make a table of values for the equation.  Graph the equation.  If Leon has less than 5 gallons of gas left, how many miles has he driven since his last fill-up? Illustrate on the graph.    We use the form for a linear model, However, in this problem, instead of variables and , we use and . Leon's fuel tank started with 20 gallons, and the amount of gasoline is decreasing at a rate of gallon for every mile that he drives. Thus,  Every time Leon drives 12 miles, he uses another gallon of gasoline. So, to make the calculations easier, we choose values that are divisible by 12.     (miles)       (gallons)       We scale the values of along the horizontal axis, and the values of along the vertical axis. Then we plot the points from the table and connect with a line, as shown in the figure below.  If Leon has less than 5 gallons of gasoline left, then , as shown on the -axis. Using our model from part (a), we solve the inequality.  Leon has driven at least 180 miles. The solution is shown on the graph below.   gas mileage   For more help on solving linear inequalities, see Section 1.1.4 of the Toolkit.  In part (d) of the previous Example we used an inequality inequality to answer the question. We use inequalities to model English phrases such as \"less than,\" \"more than,\" \"at least,\" and \"at most.\"  Practice 3 Leon forgot to reset his odometer after his last fill-up, but he thinks he has driven at least 150 miles. How much gas does he have left? Show this on the graph.  Hint: Locate 150 miles on the -axis. What part of the axis represents \"at least\" 150 miles?

  "body": "Graphs and Equations  Equations and Solutions  In the last section we studied some linear models, and in particular we looked at graphs and equations that described those models. In this section we review some techniques and terminology related to equations, inequalities, and their graphs.  Solution  A solution solution to an equation in one variable of an equation is a value of the variable that makes the equation true.  For example, is a solution of the equation because .  QuickCheck 1 Which of the following values are solutions of the equation         For more help on checking for a solution, see Section 1.2.1 of the Toolkit.  A linear equation has no powers of the variable other than 1. It has at most one solution. We find the solution by transforming the equation into a simpler equivalent equation whose solution is obvious.  Solve the equation  We begin by simplifying each side of the equation.  The solution is . You can check that substituting into the original equation produces a true statement.  For more help on solving linear equations, see Section 1.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Find the solution of the equation .   Linear Inequalities linear inequality inequality linear  Although a linear equation can have at most one solution, a linear inequality can have many solutions. For example, complete the table of values for the expression :                      Now use your table to list at least three solutions of the inequality .  Use algebra to solve the inequality .  We begin by isolating the term containing the variable, just as we do when solving a linear equation. We subtract 5 from both sides to obtain Then we divide both sides by to find Any value of greater than is a solution of the inequality. We write the solutions as . Because we cannot list all of these solutions, we often illustrate them as a graph on a number line , as shown below.  number line for inequality   In the Example above, we used the following rule for solving linear inequalities.  Solving a Linear Inequality linear inequality inequality linear  If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality.   Other than the rule stated in the box above, the rules for solving a linear inequality are the same as the rules for solving a linear equation.  For more help on solving linear inequalities, see Section 1.1.4 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2 Which of the following show the correct solutions of the inequality?   has solution  has solution  has solution  has solution   Practice 2 Solve the inequality , and graph the solutions on a number line.  number line for inequality    Equations in Two Variables equation in two variables  An equation in two variables , such as has many solutions. Each solution solution to an equation in two variables consists of an ordered pair of values, one for and one for , that together satisfy the equation (make the equation true.)  QuickCheck 3 What is the solution of an equation in two variables?   A value of that makes the equation true  An ordered pair of values that satisfy the equation  Solving the equation for in terms of  The graph of the equation    Is a solution of the equation ?  Is a solution of the equation ?    The ordered pair is a solution of the equation above, because it satifies the equation.  The ordered pair is not a solution, because it does not satify the equation.   For more help on finding solutions of an equation in two variables, see Section 1.2.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3 Find some more solutions of the equation and complete the table of values:                                 Because an equation in two variables may have many solutions, we can use a graph to visualize those solutions.  Graph graph  The graph graph of an equation in two variables is just a picture of all its solutions.   You might think it would be difficult to find all the solutions of an equation, but for a linear equation , we can at least illustrate the solutions: all the solutions lie on a straight line. (Later on we can prove that this is true.)  QuickCheck 4 True or false?  All the solutions of a linear equation in two variables lie on a straight line.  The equation is a linear equation.  The graph of an equation in two variables is a picture of its solutions.  If a point lies on the graph of an equation, it is a solution of the equation.   The figure shows a graph of the equation . Which of the following equations are true?     line and points   The point lies on the graph, so , is a solution of the equation. Thus, , or is a true statement.  The point does not lie on the graph, so , does not satisfy the equation, and is a not true.  The point does lie on the graph, so , does satisfy the equation, and is a true statement.  Practice 4 On the grid below, plot the points you found in Practice 3. All the points should lie on a straight line; draw the line with a ruler or straightedge. Which of the following points lie on the graph?  grid       Which of the points above satisfy the equation in Practice 3? grid  lies on the graph and satisfies the equation.   Graphical Solution of Equations and Inequalities equation graphical solution  Here is a clever way to solve an equation in one variable by using a graph. Suppose we would like to solve the equation . We start by looking at the graph of .  Use the graph of to solve the equation   Compare the two equations in the problem. In the equation we want to solve, has been replaced by . We begin by locating the point on the graph for which .  Next we find the -coordinate of point by drawing an imaginary line from straight down to the -axis. The -coordinate of is .   function graph  Thus, is the point , and when . The solution we seek is .  You can verify the solution algebraically by substituting into the equation:  Does ?    The relationship between an equation and its graph is an important one. For the previous example, make sure you understand that the following three statements are equivalent.   The point lies on the graph of .  The ordered pair is a solution of the equation .  is a solution of the equation .   Practice 5   Use the graph of to solve the equation . Follow the steps:  Step 1: Locate the point on the graph with .  Step 2: Find the -coordinate of your point .   Verify your solution algebraically.   line  We can also use graphs to solve inequalities. Consider the inequality To solve this inequality means to find all values of that make the expression greater than or equal to 150. We could begin by trying some values of . Here is a table obtained by evaluating .                      From the table, we see that values of less than or equal to 8 are solutions of the inequality, but we have not checked all possible -values. We can get a more complete picture from a graph.  Use the graph of the equation to solve the inequality   We look for points on the graph with -coordinates greater than or equal to 150. These points are shown in color. Which -values produced these points?  We can read the -coordinates by dropping straight down to the -axis, as shown by the arows. For example, the -value corresponding to is . For larger values of , we must choose -values less than 9. Thus, all values of less than or equal to 9 are solutions, as shown on the -axis.  linear inequality  We write the solutions as .   Practice 6   Use the graph of to solve the inequality . Follow the steps:  Step 1: Locate the point on the graph with .  Step 2: Find the -coordinate of the point .  Step 3: Which points on the graph have ? Mark them on the graph.  Step 4: Find the -coordinates of the points in Step 3. Mark them all on the -axis.   Verify your solution algebraically.   line   Using a Graphing Utility  We can use a graphing utility to graph equations if they are written in the form . First, let's review how to solve an equation for in terms of .  Solve the equation for in terms of .  To begin, we isolate the -term by subtracting from both sides of the equation. Note that the equation now has the form of the linear models we saw in Section 1.1 .  Practice 7 Solve for in terms of :  Now we are ready to graph an equation with technology. For most graphing utilities, we follow three steps.  To Graph an Equation   Enter the equation you wish to graph.  Select a graphing window.  Graph.   Choosing a graphing window corresponds to drawing the - and -axes and marking a scale on each axis when we graph by hand. The standard graphing window displays values from to on both axes. We can start with this window and then adjust it if necessary.  Use a graphing utility to graph the equation .  First, we solve the equation for in terms of .  Now enter after , and choose the standard graphing window. The graph is shown at right.  Graphing calculator line   Don't forget to erase your graph when you are done.  Practice 8  Solve the equation for in terms of .  Graph the equation in the standard window.    graph   We can use the TRACE feature to find the coordinates of points on a graph.  Use a graph to find a solution to the equation with -coordinate .  First we graph the equation in the window   Xmin   Xmax   Ymin   Ymax   GC trace  We press TRACE , and a \"bug\" begins flashing on the display. The coordinates of the bug appear at the bottom of the display, as shown in the figure. We use the left and right arrows to move the bug along the graph. You can check that the coordinates of the point do satisfy the equation .   Practice 9  Graph the equation in the window:   Xmin  Xmax  Xscl  Ymin  Ymax  Yscl   Use the Trace feature to find the point that has -coordinate .

  "body": "Slope slope   The introduction to Chapter 1 discussed the rise in sea level over the last few decades. One of the contributing factors to this rise is the melting of Earth's glaciers.  Glaciers around the world are retreating at accelerating rates, and many lower-latitude mountain glaciers may soon disappear entirely. The meltwater from these smaller glaciers contributed as much as 40% to the total rise in sea level over the 1990s.  By measuring the change in ice and snow height at fixed points and multiplying by the surface area surface area of the glacier, scientists calculate the total volume volume of water lost from land-based glaciers. Dividing this volume by the surface area of the world's oceans gives the resulting change in sea level.  The graphs below show the change in thickness of the land-based glaciers overthe past 5 years, and the rise in sea level attributed to their melting. In this section we consider how to measure a rate of change.  graphs of change in glacier thickness and resulting rise in sea level   Rate of Change rate of change  The equation we use to describe a linear model, , gives the starting value of the variable and the rate at which changes. Now we will look more closely at rates and how they appear on the graph of the model. First, let's review the notion of a ratio used as a rate. You are already familiar with several types of rates.  Rate rate  A rate is a type of ratio that compares two quantities with different units.   QuickCheck 1 A ratio that compares two quantities with different units is called a .  In the examples below, notice that each rate has units of the form , which we read as \"something per something else.\"  Caryn bought 7 used paperback novels for a total of $2.45. Use a ratio to calculate the price per book.   The novels were priced at a rate of $0.35 per book.  For more help on using ratios and rates, see Section 1.4.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Delbert biked 34 miles in 5 hours. Use a ratio to calculate his average speed.  Delbert biked at a rate of . 6.8 miles per hour  The rate you calculated in Practice 1, Delbert's average speed, actually compares the change in two variables, his distance from his starting point, and the time elapsed. This type of rate appears often in linear models.  Rate of Change  A rate of change rate of change rate of change slope is a special kind of ratio that compares the change in two quantities or variables.  In the next Example we calculate speed as a rate of change, and we introduce a new notation, , to help with the calculation.  Gregor is driving across Montana. At 1 pm his trip odometer reads 189 miles, and at 4 pm it reads 360 miles. Calculate Gregor's average speed as a rate of change.  We have two variables: time, , and distance, , and the following data points:          Gregor's speed is the ratio of the distance he traveled to the time it took. The distance he traveled is the change in his odometer reading (from 189 miles to 360 miles), and the time it took is the change in the clock reading (from 1 pm to 4 pm).The units of this ratio are miles per hour.  In mathematics, we use the symbol Delta ( ) (delta) for change in change in Delta ( ) . Thus Gregor's average speed is the ratio , so   QuickCheck 2 What does the symbol stand for?   A triangle  Speed  Change in  Coordinate   Practice 2 Nelson is a long-distance truck driver. On a recent trip through the Midwest, he noted these odometer readings:   4 am  127 miles  10 am  421 miles   What was Nelson's average speed? 49 miles per hour   How do we see the rate of change on a graph? Let's consider the example above. The graph shows Gregor's distance, , at time . We plot the two data points, and , and draw a straight line joining them. We can illustrate and by vertical and horizontal line segments, as shown on the graph.  delta d and delta t on line  The rate of change of distance with respect to time, or speed, is the ratio of to . It measures how much changes for each unit increase in , or how far Gregor travels in each hour. This quantity, the ratio , is the slope of the line .  For more help calculating slope from a graph, see Section 1.4.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 3 What feature of a graph illustrates rate of change?   The -axis  Slope  Scales on the axes  The coordinate of a point    Review of Slope slope  You may have encountered the notion of slope in previous courses. Let us see how slope is related to rate of change.  Slope slope  The slope of a line is a rate of change that measures the steepness of the line.   The slope tells us how much the -coordinate changes for each unit of increase in the -coordinate, as we move from one point to another along the line.  QuickCheck 4 The slope of a line tells us how much the -coordinate changes   from one end of the graph to the other.  as we move up the -axis.  from one point to the next point.  for each unit of increase in the -coordinate.   Using the notation for \"change in,\" we define slope as follows.  Slope of a Line slope slope of a line   or, in symbols   In the definition of slope,   How does slope measure the steepness of a line? Study the three examples below and notice how changes for each 1 unit increase in .    line A  increases by 2 units    line B  increases by units    line C  decreases by 2 units    From these examples, we can make the following observations:  Slope and Steepness slope   For positive slopes, the larger the value of , the more the -value increases for each unit increase in , and the more we climb up as our location changes from left to right. (So graph A is steeper than graph B.) slope positive  If decreases as we move from left to right, then is negative when is positive, so their ratio (the slope) is negative. (See graph C.) slope positive     Compute the slope of the line.  Illustrate the slope on the graph by drawing a vertical segment of length and a horizontal segment of length .  If , what is the length of the vertical segment?   line with different scales on axes    The points and lie on the graph. As we move from the first point to the second point, increases by 20 units, so , and increases by 500 units, so . Thus   The segments are shown in the graph below.  line with different scales on axes   The slope is 25, which means that increases 25 units for each 1-unit increase in . So, if , then .   For more examples of calculating slope, see Section 1.4.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3   Compute the slope of the line.  Illustrate the slope on the graph by drawing a vertical segment for and a horizontal segment for .  If , what is the length of the vertical segment?   negative slope line with different scales on axes   negative slope line with different scales on axes     Interpreting Slope as a Rate  By putting together all of our discussion so far, we can now see that the slope of a line measures the rate of change of with respect to .  The graph shows the altitude, (in feet), of a skier minutes after getting on a ski lift.    Choose two points on the graph and compute the slope, including units.  Explain what the slope measures in this problem.  Write a linear model for in terms of .   altitude vs time   We choose the points and , as shown on the graph. Then  The slope gives the rate of change of altitude with respect to time. The skier rises at a rate of 150 feet per minute.  A linear model has the form From the graph, we see that at the skier's altitude was , and we calculated the rate of change of altitude as 150 feet per minute. Substituting these values into the formula, we find   For more help interpretine slope, see Section 1.4.3 of the Toolkit.  Slope as a Rate of Change slope rate of change   The slope of a line measures the rate of change of with respect to .  The units of and can help us interpret the slope as a rate.    Practice 4 The graph shows the amount of garbage (in tons) that has been deposited at a dumpsite years after new regulations go into effect.    Choose two points on the graph and compute the slope, including units.  Explain what the slope measures in this problem.  Choose two different points and compute the slope again. Do you get the same value as before?   linear graph of garbage deposited  12.5 tons per year  The slope gives the rate at which garbage is accumulating.  The slope is the same using any two points on the line.    Lines Have Constant Slope  You have probably already noticed the following important fact about lines.  Lines Have Constant Slope  The slope of a line is constant: no matter which two points you pick to compute the slope, you will always get the same value.   For the line shown in the figure, try computing the slope using the points and , and then using the points and . In each case, you should find that the slope is .  Here is another way to look at slopes. If we start at any point on the line shown and move 9 units to the right, what value of will bring us back to the line? We can use the slope formula with .   line   You can use the graph to check this result for yourself; try starting at the point .  The fact that lines have constant slope has two important consequences. First because is constant for a given line, we can use the formula to find when we know , or to find when we know .  QuickCheck 5 What formula can we use to find when we know , or when we know ?

What horizontal distance is needed if the ramp must climb an elevation of 4 feet?   We first draw a sketch of the wheelchair ramp and label and . We are given that feet, and we are looking for . We substitute the known values into the slope formula, and solve for .  ramp  The wheelchair ramp must have a horizontal length of feet, or 16 feet 8 inches.   Practice 5 A wheelchair ramp can have a slope of no more than 24%, or 0.24. What height can the wheelchair ramp climb over a horizontal distance of 10 feet?  Hint: Do we know the value of or of ? 2.4 ft  Here is a second consequence of the fact that lines have constant slope: We can tell whether a collection of data points lies on a straight line by computing slopes. If the slopes between pairs of data points are all the same, the points lie on a straight line.  QuickCheck 6 How can we can tell whether a collection of data points lies on a straight line?   Plot them and look at the graph.  Calculate the slopes between points.  Find an equation for the line.  It depends on the scales on the axes.   Could this table represent a linear equation? Explain why or why not.                  We compute the slope between each consecutive pair of points. In each case Because the slope is the same for all pairs of points, the table could be linear.   Practice 6 Could this table represent a linear equation? Explain why or why not.    5  10  15  20  25   0  3  6  12  24   Hint: Calculate the slopes between points. No, the slope between points is not constant.  To summarize, here are two ways that we can use the slope to study a model.  Two Uses for Slope   If we know the slope of a line, we can use the formula to find when we know , or to find when we know .  To test whether a collection of data points lies on a straight line, we can compute slopes. If the slopes between all pairs of data points are the same, the points lie on a straight line.

The ice component of the climate system, called the cryosphere , plays an important role in the Earth's radiation balance.  Climate models predict that global warming over the next few decades will occur mainly in the polar regions. As polar ice begins to melt, less sunlight is reflected into space, which raises the overall temperature and fuels further melting. This process is called ice albedo feedback . Since satellite monitoring began in 1979, Arctic sea ice cover has decreased about 10% per decade, falling to a startling new low in 2007.  annual sea ice minimum  Numerous factors influence the freezing point of sea water, including its salinity, or mineral content.

However, if the coordinates are not easy, or if we don't have a graph, we may need another method.  You know that to calculate the net change net change between two points on a number line, we can subtract their coordinates. That is,  For example, if you walk from street to street, your distance, , from the center of town has increased by 5 blocks, or If the temperature drops from to , it has decreased by , or   The net change is positive if the variable increases, and negative if it decreases. For the graph shown at right, the net change in -coordinate from to is  horizontal change -23 to 51  We can use the notion of net change to write a coordinate formula for computing slope. We will need subscripts to designate the coordinates of two different points. We'll write for the coordinates of the first point, and for the coordinates of the second point.  Do not confuse subscripts with exponents! An exponent changes the value of a variable, so that for instance if then , but a subscript merely tells us which point the variable comes from, so that just means \"the -coordinate of the second point.\"  Coordinate Formula for Slope coordinate formula for slope slope coordinate formula for  If and are two points on a line, then the slope of the line is given by as long as   Notice that the numerator of the slope formula, , gives the net change in , or , and the denominator, , gives the net change in , or . The coordinate formula is equivalent to our definition of slope, .  QuickCheck 2 In the coordinate formula for slope, why do we require that ?   The slope cannot be zero.  The two points cannot be the same.  The denominator of a fraction cannot be zero.  The denominator must equal 1.

The coordinates of are . (Do you see why?) Then and thus  The slope gives us a rate of change, and the units of the variables help us interpret the slope in context. Over the ten years between 1993 and 2003, wine consumption in the US increased at a rate of 6.97 million cases per year.   For more help calculating slope, see Section 1.5.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 2 In 1991, there were 64.6 burglaries per 1000 households in the United States. The number of burglaries reported annually declined at a roughly constant rate over the next decade, and in 2001 there were 28.7 burglaries per 1000 households.

Point-Slope Formula point-slope formula linear equation point-slope formula  Now we'll consider using the slope formula for a different problem. If we know the slope of a line and the coordinates of one point on the line, we can use the coordinate formula for slope to find the -coordinate of any other point on the line.  Instead of evaluating the formula to find , we substitute the values we know for and for . If we then plug in the -coordinate of any unknown point, we can solve for .  QuickCheck 3 A line has slope and passes through the point . Which equation can you use to find the -coordinate of the point on the line with -coordinate 6?        Remember that the equation for a line is really just a formula that gives the -coordinate of any point on the line in terms of its -coordinate. So, if we know the slope of a particular line and one point on the line, we can use the coordinate formula for slope to find its equation.   Graph the line that passes through the point and has .  Find an equation for the line in part (a).      We first plot the given point, , and then use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is , so starting from we move down 3 units and then 4 units to the right. This brings us to the point . We draw the line through these two points.  point slope  To find an equation for the line, we start with the slope formula, We substitute for the slope, , and for . For the second point, , we substitute the variable point to obtain  This is an equation for the line, but if we want to solve for , we first multiply both sides by . In slope-intercept form, the equation of the line is .    For more help graphing with the point-slope form, see Section 1.5.4 of the Toolkit.  When we use the slope formula to find the equation of a line, we substitute a variable point for the second point.

Finding a Linear Model linear model linear model linear equation  Now we are ready to find the equation promised in the introduction to this section: a formula for the freezing temperature of water in terms of its salinity.  When we have two data points for a linear model, we can find its equation using two steps:  first we compute the slope of the line,  then we use the point-slope formula.   Sea water does not freeze at exactly 32 F because of its salinity. The temperature at which water freezes depends on its dissolved mineral content. A common unit for measuring salinity is parts per thousand, or ppt. For example, salinity of 8 ppt means 8 grams of dissolved salts in each kilogram of water. Here are some data for the freezing temperature of water.    Salinity (ppt),      Freezing temperature ( F),       Do these data points describe a linear model? Why or why not?  Find a linear equation for freezing temperature, , in terms of salinity, .  Step 1: Find the slope.  Step 2: Use the point-slope formula.  What is the salinity of water that freezes at 32 F?  Sea water has an average salinity of 35 ppt. What is the freezing point of sea water?    We check to see if the slope between each pair of points is the same. Because the slopes are the same, the data could describe a linear model.  Step 1: In part (a) we found the slope:  Step 2: We substitute the slope and either point into the point-slope formula.  If in our equation, then must be zero, so pure water (no salinity) freezes at 32 F.  We substitute 35 for in our equation. Sea water freezes at 30.04 F.   Practice 4 The fee for registering a new car is given by a linear equation that depends on the car's value. The fee for a $15,000 car is $128.50, and the fee for a $25,000 car is $193.50.   Find a linear equation that gives the registration fee for a new car that cost dollars.  Use your equation to estimate the registration fee for a car that costs $22,000.  What is the slope of your line? What does the slope mean for registration fees?    $174  : The registration fee increases by 0.65% of the value of the car.    Summary  In this section, we studied three different formulas associated with linear equations: the slope-intercept formula, the coordinate formula for slope, and the point-slope formula. How are these formulas related, and how are they different?   The slope-intercept form , , is just a special case of the point-slope formula . If the given point happens to be the -intercept y -intercept  , then the point-slope formula reduces to the familiar form: We can use the (shorter) slope-intercept form if we are lucky enough to know the -intercept of the line.  What is the difference between the slope formula  and the point-slope formula  They are really the same formula, but they are used for different purposes:  The slope formula is used to calculate the slope when we know two points. We know and , and we are looking for .  The point-slope formula is used to find the equation of a line. We know and , and we are looking for .

We can describe a relationship between variables with a table of values, a graph, or an equation.  Linear models have equations of the form:   The general form for a linear equation is: .  We can use the intercepts to graph a line. The intercepts are also useful for interpreting a model.  The graph of an equation in two variables is just a picture of all its solutions.  Lines have constant slope.  The slope of a line gives us the rate of change of one variable with respect to another.  Formulas for Linear Models   slope:  ,    slope-intercept form:     point-slopet form:      The slope-intercept form is useful when we know the initial value and the rate of change.  The point-slope form is useful when we know the rate of change and one point on the line.  .    Chapter 1 Review Problems  Last year, Pinwheel Industries introduced a new model calculator.

The Amazon rain forest is home to the largest collection of plant and animal species in the world, including more than one-third of all living species. During the 1960s, colonists began cutting down the rain forest to clear land for agriculture. The construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway in the early 1970s opened large forest areas to development by settlers and commercial interests, increasing the rate of deforestation.  Environmentalists are concerned about the loss of biodiversity which will result from destruction of the forest, and about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming.  In Brazil, the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE, or National Institute of Space Research) uses Landsat satellite photos to monitor the pace of deforestation. According to their data, the original Amazon rain forest biome in Brazil of 4,100,000 square kilometers was reduced to 3,413,000 square kilometers by 2005, representing a loss of 16.8%. The figures for 1987 to 2006 are shown at right, and a plot of the data appears below.

Although the data points do not all lie exactly on a straight line, they are very close. One question we might ask is: If deforestation continues at the same rate, when will the Amazon rain forest disappear completely? In this section we learn to find a linear model that approximates a data set.   Line of Best Fit least-squares regression line line of best fit least-squares regression line linear regression line of best fit  In most cases, a mathematical model is not a perfect description of reality. Many factors can affect empirical data, including measurement error, environmental conditions, and the influence of related variables. Nonetheless, we can often find an equation that approximates the data in a useful way.  The table shows the minimum wage in the US at five-year intervals.

Are the data linear?  Draw a line that \"fits\" the data.    scatterplot of minimum wage     The graph shown is called a scatterplot scatterplot . The data are not strictly linear, because the slope is not constant: from 1960 to 1965, the minimum wage increased at an average rate of and from 1970 to 1975, the minimum wage increased at a rate of However, the data points do appear to lie close to an imaginary line.   We would like to draw a line that comes as close as possible to all the data points, even though it may not pass precisely through any of them. In particular, we try to adjust the line so that we have the same number of points above the line and below the line. One possible solution is shown in the figure at right.  scatterplot of minimum wage    To see more examples of line of best fit, see Section 2.1.2 of the Toolkit.  A line that fits the data in a scatterplot is called a regression line regression line regression line linear regression line regression . Drawing a regression line by eye is a subjective process. Using technology, we can compute a particular regression line called the least-squares regression line least-squares regression line linear regression least-squares regression line , which is widely used in statistics and modeling.  We can still find an equation for a line of best fit using the point-slope formula . (To review using the point-slope formula, see Finding a Linear Model in Section 1.5.) We choose two points on the line whose coordinates we can estimate fairly accurately. Note that these two points need not be any of the original data points.  QuickCheck 1 Explain how to find the equation of a regression line.   Choose two data points and use the point-slope formula.  Use the point-slope formula with the first and last data points.  The regression line must pass through two data points, and we use the point-slope formula for those points.  Choose two points on the regression line and use the point-slope formula.   Practice 1 The regression line in the Example above appears to pass through the points and . Use those points to find an equation for the regression line.  Hint: Step 1 Calculate the slope.  Step 2 Use the point-slope formula.  To review finding the equation of a line, see Section 2.1.3 of the Toolkit.

Use your equation to predict the number of cups of cocoa that will be sold when the temperature is , and when the temperature is    The scatterplot and a regression line are shown in the figure.  scatterplot with regression line  The regression line need not pass through any of the data points, but it should be as close as possible. We try to draw the regression line so that there are an equal number of data points above and below the line.  The points and appear to lie on the regression line. According to this model, the snack bar will sell 32 cups of cocoa when the temperature is , and 12 cups when it is . These values are close to the actual data, but not exact.  To find an equation for the regression line, we use two points on the line not data points! We will use and . First we compute the slope Next, we apply the point-slope formula. We'll use the point .  When , We predict that the snack bar will sell 29 or 30 cups of cocoa when the temperature is . When , Because the snack bar cannot sell cups of cocoa, this prediction is not useful. (What is the Fahrenheit equivalent of 24°C?)   Using a regression line to estimate values between known data points is called interpolation interpolation linear regression interpolation . If the data points lie fairly close to the regression line, then interpolation will usually give a fairly accurate estimate. In the Example above, the estimate of 29 or 30 cups of cocoa at seems reasonable in the context of the data.  Making predictions beyond the range of known data is called extrapolation extrapolation linear regression extrapolation . Extrapolation can often give useful information, but if we try to extrapolate too far beyond our data, we may get unreasonable results. The conditions that produced the data may no longer hold, as in the Example above, or other unexpected conditions may arise to alter the situation.  QuickCheck 2 True or false.  A scatterplot is a type of linear model.  A regression line should give the same -values as the data points.  We use interpolation to estimate the -value at a data point.  Extrapolation is usually more reliable than interpolation.   Practice 2  Use your regression equation from the previous Example to predict the number of cups of cocoa sold when the temperature is .

Why?   77  34 or 35  (b), because it is interpolation    Scatterplots  The data in a scatterplot may show a linear trend, even though the individual points are not clustered closely around a line. Scattering of data is common in the social sciences, where many variables may influence a particular situation. Nonetheless, by analyzing the data, we may be able to detect a connection between some of the variables.  The world's population is growing at different rates in different nations. Many factors, including economic and social forces, influence the birthrate. Is there a connection between birth rates and education levels?

To begin, think about the two equations in the next Investigation.  Water Level  When sailing upstream in a canal or a river that has rapids, ships must sometimes negotiate locks to raise them to a higher water level. Suppose your ship is in one of the lower locks, at an elevation of 20 feet. The next lock is at an elevation of 50 feet. Water begins to flow from the higher lock to the lower one, raising your level by 1 foot per minute, and simultaneously lowering the water level in the next lock by 1.5 feet per minute.

Write an equation you can use to verify your answer to part (5), and solve it.     Systems of Equations  A biologist wants to know the average weights of two species of birds in a wildlife preserve. She sets up a feeder whose platform is actually a scale and mounts a camera to monitor the feeder. She waits until the feeder is occupied only by members of the two species she is studying, robins and thrushes. Then she takes a picture, which records the number of each species on the scale and the total weight registered.  From her two best pictures, she obtains the following information. The total weight of 3 thrushes and 6 robins is 48 ounces, and the total weight of 5 thrushes and 2 robins is 32 ounces. The biologist writes two equations about the photos. She begins by assigning variables to the two unknown quantities: In each of the photos, So the two equations are  To review writing an expression for a linear model, see Section 2.2.1 of the Toolkit.  This pair of equations is an example of a linear system of two equations in two unknowns system of equations linear system (or a linear system, for short). A solution solution to a system of equations system of equations solution to the system is an ordered pair of numbers, , that satisfies both equations in the system.  QuickCheck 1 Choose the solution of the system:         Solving Systems by Graphing system of equations graphing  Recall that every point on the graph of an equation represents a solution to that equation, so a solution to both equations must be a point that lies on both graphs. Therefore, a solution to the system is a point where the two graphs intersect.   The figure at right shows a graph of the system about robins and thrushes. The two lines appear to intersect at the point , so we expect that the values and are the solution to the system. We can check by verifying that these values satisfy both equations in the system  two lines in first quadrant  Both equations are true, so we have found the solution: a thrush weighs 4 ounces on average, and a robin weighs 6 ounces.  To review solutions of linear systems, see Section 2.2.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2 True or false.  The point where two lines cross is called the intercept .  The intercepts of a line are the points where it intersects the axes.  The solution of a system may occur at an intercept.  The words intercept and intersect mean the same thing.   We can use a calculator or graphing utility to graph the equations in a system.  Use your grapher to solve the system by graphing.   We set the graphing window to        and enter the two equations. We can see in the figure that the two lines intersect in the third quadrant. We use the TRACE feature to find the coordinates of the intersection point, . The solution to the system is , .  GC display of 2 lines intersecting in 3rd quadrant   To learn about graphing equations with GeoGebra, see Appendix B.  The values we obtain from a calculator may be only approximations, so it is a good idea to check the solution algebraically. In the example above, we find that both equations are true when we substitute and .  Practice 1  Solve the system of equations by graphing. Use the window  Verify algebraically that your solution satisfies both equations.      Because the TRACE feature does not show every point on a graph, we may not find the exact solution to a system by tracing the graphs.  Solve the system  We can graph this system in the standard window by solving each equation for . We enter and use the standard window. If we trace along the graph to the intersection point, we will not find the same coordinates on both lines. The intersection point is not displayed in this window. Instead, we can use the intersect feature of the grapher.  Follow the instructions for your grapher's intersect feature to find the intersection point, , .  We can substitute these values into the original system to check that they satisfy both equations.   Practice 2 Solve the system of equations by graphing. Estimate the intercepts of each graph to help you choose a suitable window, and use the intersect feature to locate the solution.  How does the calculator find the exact coordinates of the intersection point? In the next section we’ll learn how to find the solution of a system using algebra.   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems dependent system system of equations system of equations inconsistent  Because two straight lines do not always intersect at a single point, a system of linear equations does not always have a unique solution. In fact, there are three possibilities, as illustrated below.  3 cases for 2x2 linear system, namely two lines intersecting in a single point, two parallel lines, or two coincident lines  Solutions of Linear Systems linear system system of equations system of equations solution solution to a system of equations consistent system of equations system of equations consistent and independent inconsistent system system of equations system of equations inconsistent system of equations dependent system of equations independent  There are three types of linear system linear system :  Consistent and independent system independent system system of equations . The graphs of the two lines intersect in exactly one point. The system has exactly one solution.  Inconsistent system inconsistent . The graphs of the equations are parallel lines and hence do not intersect. An inconsistent system has no solutions.  Dependent system dependent . All the solutions of one equation are also solutions to the second equation, and hence are solutions of the system. The graphs of the two equations are the same line. A dependent system has infinitely many solutions.   Solve each system.     We can use technology to graph both equations on the same axes. First, we rewrite the second equation in slope-intercept form by solving for . We enter the equations as You should see that the lines do not intersect within the viewing window; they appear to be parallel. If we look again at the equations of the lines, we recognize that both have slope but different -intercepts, so they are parallel. Because parallel lines never meet, there is no solution to the system.  This time we will graph by hand. We begin by writing each equation in slope-intercept form.   For the second equation,  one line with two equations  The two equations are actually different forms of the same equation. They are equivalent, so they share the same line as a graph. Every point on the first line is also a point on the second line, and hence a solution of the system. The system has infinitely many solutions.  QuickCheck 3 Complete the statements.  If two lines have the same slope but different -intercepts, the system is .  If two lines have the same slope and the same -intercept, the system is .  If two lines have the same -intercept but different slopes, the system is .  If both lines are horizontal, the system is .   Practice 3  Graph the system by hand, using either the intercept method or the slope-intercept method.  Identify the system as dependent, inconsistent, or consistent and independent.   parallel lines  Inconsistent: The graph is two parallel lines.    Applications  Systems of equations are useful in many applied problems. Here are two examples from economics.  A business venture calculates its profit profit by subtracting its costs cost from its revenue revenue , the amount of money it takes in from sales. Cost is usually calculated as the sum of fixed costs, or overhead, and variable costs, the cost of labor and materials to produce its product. Revenue is the product of the selling price per item times the number of items sold. If the company’s revenue exactly equals its costs (so that their profit is zero), we say that the business venture will break even break even .  To see more examples of the profit equation, see Section 2.2.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4 The Aquarius jewelry company determines that each production run to manufacture a pendant involves an initial setup cost of $200 and $4 for each pendant produced. The pendants sell for $12 each.  Express the cost of production in terms of the number of pendants produced.  Express the revenue in terms of the number of pendants sold.  Graph the revenue and cost on the same set of axes. (Find the intercepts of each equation to help you choose a window for the graph.) State the solution of the system.  How many pendants must be sold for the Aquarius company to break even on a particular production run?      They must sell 25 pendants to break even.   Another example involves supply and demand. The owner of a retail business must try to balance the demand for his product from consumers with the supply he can obtain from manufacturers. Supply and demand both vary with the price of the product: consumers usually buy fewer items if the price increases, but manufacturers will be willing to supply more units of the product if its price increases.  The demand equation demand equation equation demand gives the number of units of the product that consumers will buy at a given price. The supply equation supply equation equation supply gives the number of units that the producer will supply at that price. The price at which the supply and demand are equal is called the equilibrium price equilibrium price . This is the price at which the consumer and the producer agree to do business.  A woolens mill can produce yards of fine suit fabric if it can charge dollars per yard. The mill's clients in the garment industry will buy yards of wool fabric at a price of dollars per yard. Find the equilibrium price and the amount of fabric that will change hands at that price.   Step 1  We choose variables for the unknown quantities.   Price per yard:   Number of yards:    Step 2  The supply equation tells us how many yards of fabric the mill will produce for a price of dollars per yard. The demand equation tells us how many yards of fabric the garment industry will buy at a price of dollars per yard.  Step 3  We graph the two equations on the same set of axes, as shown below. We set the window values to and use the TRACE or the intersect command to locate the solution. The graphs intersect at the point .  GC graph of supply and demand of wool fabric  Step 4  The equilibrium price is $12 per yard, and the mill will sell 4800 yards of fabric at that price.

  "body": "Algebraic Solution of Systems   In the previous section we used graphs to solve a system of two linear equations in two unknowns. Graphs help us visualize the system and its solution, but do not always provide the most efficient or most accurate way to find the solution. In this section we review two methods for solving a 2x2 linear system algebraically.   Substitution Method system of equations substitution method substitution method system of equations  You may be familiar with the substitution method for solving a system of equations. The idea is to write an expression for one of the variables in terms of the other variable, and then substitute that expression into the other equation.  Solve the system   If we solve the first equation for , we get . We can substitute the expression for into the second equation to get an equation in only one variable. Finally, we solve this equation: And because , we find . The solution is . We may sometimes write the solution as an ordered pair, .   Here is a summary of the steps for solving a system by substitution.  To Solve a System by Substitution   Choose one of the variables in one of the equations. (It is best to choose a variable whose coefficient is or .) Solve the equation for that variable.  Substitute the result of Step 1 into the other equation. This gives an equation in one variable.  Solve the equation obtained in Step 2. This gives the solution value for one of the variables.  Substitute this value into the result of Step 1 to find the solution value of the other variable.    QuickCheck 1 What is the first step in the substitution method?   Solve both equations for .  Substitute a value for .  Solve one of the equations for one of the variables.  Add the equations together.   Practice 1 Follow the suggested steps to solve the system by substitution:   Step 1: Solve the second equation for in terms of .  Step 2: Substitute your expression for into the first equation.  Step 3: Solve the equation you got in Step 2.  Step 4: You now have the solution value for . Substitute that value into your result from Step 1 to find the solution value for .  As always, you should check that your solution values satisfy both equations in the system.    Elimination Method elimination method elimination method system of equations system of equations elimination method  A second algebraic method for solving systems is called elimination . As with the substitution method, we obtain an equation in a single variable, but we do it by eliminating one of the variables in the system. We must first put both equations into the general linear form .  Solve the system  First, we rewrite each equation in the form . We add the equations together by adding the left side of the first equation to the left side of the second equation, and then adding the two right sides together, as follows: Note that the -terms canceled, or were eliminated . Solving the new equation, , we find that . We are not finished yet, because we must still find the value of . We can substitute our value for into either of the original equations, and solve for . We'll use the second equation, : Thus, the solution is the point .  QuickCheck 2 In order to use the elimination method, in what form should you write the equations?   Point-slope form  Slope-intercept form  General linear form  Coordinate form   In the previous Example , the elimination method worked because the coefficients of in the two equations were opposites, and . This caused the -terms to cancel out when we added the two equations together. What if the coefficients of neither nor are opposites? Then we must multiply one or both of the equations in the system by a suitable constant.  Consider the system We can eliminate the -terms if we multiply each term of the second equation by , so that the coefficients of will be opposites: Be careful to multiply each term by , not just the -term. We can now replace the second equation by its new version to obtain this system:  Practice 2 Follow the suggested steps to solve the system   Step 1: Add the equations together.  Step 2: Solve the resulting equation for .  Step 3: Substitute your value for into either original equation and solve for .  Step 4: Check that your solution satisfies both original equations.   QuickCheck 3 Before adding the two equations together, we must arrange it so that the coefficients of one of the variables are .  When we add a multiple of one equation to the other we are making a linear combination linear combination  system of equations linear combination of the equations. The method of elimination is also called the method of linear combinations. Sometimes we need to multiply both equations by suitable constants in order to eliminate one of the variables.  Use linear combinations to solve the system   This time we choose to eliminate the -terms. We must arrange things so that the coefficients of the -terms are opposites, so we look for the smallest integer that both 2 and 5 divide into evenly. (This number is called the lowest common multiple lowest common multiple (LCM) , or LCM , of 2 and 5.) The LCM of 2 and 5 is 10. We want one of the coefficients of to be , and the other to be .  To achieve this, we multiply the first equation by and the second equation by . Adding these new equations eliminates the -term and yields an equation in . We solve for to find . Finally, we substitute into the first equation and solve for . The solution of the system is the point .  QuickCheck 4 What is the name of the smallest integer that two integers, and , divide into evenly?   The divisor  The quotient  The lowest common multiple  The lowest common factor   Practice 3 Follow the suggested steps to solve the system by elimination First, clear the fractions: multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3.   Step 1: Write each equation in the form .  Step 2: Eliminate the -terms: Multiply each equation by an appropriate constant.  Step 3: Add the new equations and solve the result for .  Step 4: Substitute your value for into the second equation and solve for .   Which method should you choose to solve a particular system? Both methods work on any linear system, but the substitution method is easier if one of the variables in one of the equations has coefficient or .   Problem Solving with Systems  If there are two unknown quantities in an applied problem, it is often more easily solved by writing a system of two equations.  Staci stocks two kinds of sleeping bags in her sporting goods store, a standard model and a down-filled model for colder temperatures. From past experience, she estimates that she will sell twice as many of the standard variety as of the down-filled. She has room to stock 84 sleeping bags at a time. How many of each variety should Staci order?  We begin by choosing variables for the unknown quantities.  We write two equations about the variables. We will solve this system using substitution. Notice that the first equation is already solved for in terms of . We substitute for in the second equation to obtain Solving for , we find . Finally, substitute this value into the first equation to find The solution to the system is , . Staci should order 56 standard sleeping bags and 28 down-filled bags.  In the next Exercise, we'll use the formula for calculating the interest, , earned on an investment.  To review the interest formula, see Section 2.3.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4 Jerry invested $2000, part in a CD at 4% interest and the remainder in a business venture at 9%. After one year, his income from the business venture was $37 more than his income from the CD. How much did he invest at each rate?  Choose variables for the unknown quantities.  Fill in the table.     Principal  Interest Rate  Interest   First investment      Second investment      Write two equations; one about the principal, and one about the interest.    Solve the system. (Which method seems easiest, substitution or elimination?)  Write your answer to the question in the problem in a sentence.  Jerry invested $1100 at 4% innterest and $900 at 9% interest.  A useful application of linear systems involves mixtures. In the next Example, we use the percent formula . For instance, suppose that 35% of a class of 60 students are math majors. Then the number of math majors is  To review the percent formula, see Section 2.3.2 of the Toolkit.  A chemist wants to produce 45 milliliters of a 40% solution of carbolic acid by mixing a 20% solution with a 50% solution. How many milliliters of each should she use?  picture   We let represent the number of milliliters of the 20% solution she needs and the number of milliliters of the 50% solution. We can use a table to organize the information. The first two columns contain the variables and information given in the problem: the number of milliliters of each solution and its strength as a percent.       Number of Milliliters ( )  Percent Acid ( )  Amount of Acid ( )   20% Solution      50% Solution      Mixture      We fill in the last column of the table by using the formula . The entries in this last column give the amount of the important ingredient (in this case, milliliters of acid) in each component solution and in the mixture.       Number of Milliliters ( )  Percent Acid ( )  Amount of Acid ( )   20% Solution      50% Solution      Mixture      Now we can write two equations about the mixture problem. The first equation is about the total number of milliliters mixed together. The chemist must mix milliliters of one solution with milliliters of the other solution and end up with 45 milliliters of the mixture, so The second equation uses the fact that the acid in the mixture can only come from the acid in each of the two original solutions. We used the last column of the table to calculate how much acid was in each component, and we add these quantities to get the amount of acid in the mixture. These two equation make up a system: To simplify the system we first multiply the second equation by 100 to clear the decimals. We'll solve this system by elimination. Multiply the first equation by , and add the equations together. Solving for , we find . We substitute into the first equation to find or . The chemist needs 15 milliliters of the 20% solution and 30 milliliters of the 50% solution for the mixture.  Practice 5 Polls conducted by Senator Bluff's campaign manager show that he can win 60% of the rural vote in his state but only 45% of the urban vote. If 1,200,000 citizens vote, how many voters from rural areas and how many from urban areas must vote in order for the Senator to win 50% of the votes?  Let represent the number of rural voters and the number of urban voters. Fill in the table.     Number of Voters  Percent for Bluff  Number for Bluff   Rural      Urban      Total      Add down the first and third columns to write a system of equations.    Solve the system.  Answer the question in the problem.  800,000 rural voters and 400,000 urban voters   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems  Recall that a system of two linear equations does not always have a unique solution; it may be inconsistent or dependent. The elimination method will reveal whether the system falls into one of these two cases.  Solve each system by elimination.      parallel lines  To eliminate the -terms, we multiply the first equation by 2 and add:  Both variables are eliminated, and we are left with the false statement . There are no values of or that will make this equation true, so the system has no solutions. The graph shows that the system is inconsistent.   parallel lines  To eliminate the -terms, we multiply the first equation by and add:  We are left with the true but unhelpful equation . The two equations are in fact equivalent (one is a constant multiple of the other), so the system is dependent. The graph of both equations is shown in the figure.   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems system of equations inconsistent system of equations dependent system of equations elimination method  When using elimination to solve a system:  If combining the two equations results in an equation of the form then the system is inconsistent.  If combining the two equations results in an equation of the form then the system is dependent.   Practice 6 Identify the system as dependent, inconsistent, or consistent and independent. Dependent    Problem Set 2.3  Warm Up  Solve the system by substitution :   Step 1  Choose one of the equations, and solve for one of the variables.  Step 2  Substitute this new expression for or into the other equation.  Step 3  Notice that the new equation has only one variable. Solve the equation.  Step 4  Substitute the answer to Step 3 into the result of Step 1 to find the other variable. Write your solution as an ordered pair.  Solve the system by elimination :   Step 1  We choose to eliminate . Multiply the first equation by and the second equation by . (Why?)  Step 2  The coefficients of are now opposites. Add the two equations together.  Step 3  Solve the new equation for the remaining variable.  Step 4  Use substitution to find the other variable. Write your solution as an ordered pair.    Skills Practice  For Problems 3 6, solve the system by substitution or by linear combinations.           For Problems 7 and 8, clear the fractions in each equation first, then solve the system by substitution or by linear combinations.       For Problems 9 and 10, use linear combinations to identify each system as dependent, inconsistent, or consistent and independent.

These two equation make up a system: To simplify the system we first multiply the second equation by 100 to clear the decimals. We'll solve this system by elimination. Multiply the first equation by , and add the equations together. Solving for , we find . We substitute into the first equation to find or . The chemist needs 15 milliliters of the 20% solution and 30 milliliters of the 50% solution for the mixture. "

  "body": "Gaussian Reduction  Some problems involve many variables and equations. For example, scheduling airline flights or planning delivery routes can involve hundreds of variables and linear equations. There are efficient computer algorithms to solve such large systems. In this section we look at a method that can be generalized to many variables, but we will apply it to 3x3 linear systems.  3x3 Linear Systems  linear system 3x3 system of equations 3x3 --> A solution solution to system of equations to an equation in three variables, such as is an ordered triple ordered triple of numbers that satisfies the equation. For example, and are solutions to the equation above, but is not. You can verify this by substituting the coordinates into the equation to see if a true statement results. A linear equation in three variables has infinitely many solutions.   An ordered triple can be represented geometrically as a point in space using a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, as shown in the figure. The graph of a linear equation in three variables is a plane. A solution to a system of three linear equations in three variables is an ordered triple that satisfies each equation in the system. That triple represents a point where all three planes intersect.  point in 3D space    If the planes intersect in a single point, the system has a unique solution.  If there is no point that lies on all three planes (for instance, if at least two of the planes are parallel), the system is inconsistent.  If all three planes are the same, or if they intersect in a line, the system is dependent.   It is impractical to solve 3x3 systems by graphing. Even when technology for producing three-dimensional graphs is available, we cannot read coordinates on such graphs with any confidence. Thus, we will restrict our attention to algebraic methods of solving such systems.  QuickCheck 1  A solution to an equation in three variables is an .  The graph of a linear equation in three variables is a .  A linear 3x3 system has a unique solution if the three planes intersect in .  Three planes may also intersect in a or a .    Back-Substitution system of equations back-subsitution back-substitution  The strategy for solving a 3x3 system is the same as the strategy for 2x2 systems: we would like to reduce the system to an equation in a single variable. Once we have found the value for that variable, we substitute its value into the other equations to find the remaining unknowns.  A special case of this technique is called back-substitution back-substitution . It works when one of the equations involves exactly one variable, and a second equation involves that same variable and just one other variable. A 3x3 system with these properties is said to be in triangular form triangular form system of equations .  Solve the system  We begin by solving the third equation to find . Then we substitute for in the second equation and solve for . Finally, we substitute for and for into the first equation to find . The solution is the ordered triple . You should verify that this triple satisfies all three equations of the system.  Practice 1 Use back-substitution to solve the system   Gaussian Reduction Gaussian reduction Gaussian reduction system of equations system of equations Gaussian reduction linear combination Gaussian reduction system of equations linear combination  The method for solving a general linear system is called Gaussian reduction , after the German mathematician Carl Gauss. We use linear combinations to reduce the system to triangular form, and then use back-substitution to find the solutions.  QuickCheck 2  The method for solving a 3x3 linear system is called .  A special case of this method is called .  The special case works on systems in .  To reduce a system to the special form, we use .   To obtain the triangular form, we eliminate one of the variables from each of the three equations by considering them in pairs. This results in a system that we can solve using elimination.  To review the method of elimination, see Section 2.3 of the text.  Solve the system:   We can choose any one of the three variables to eliminate first. For this example, we will eliminate . Next, we choose two of the equations, say (1) and (2), and use a linear combination: We multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (2) to produce Equation (4).  Now we have an equation involving only two variables. But we need two equations in two unknowns to find the solution. So we choose a different pair of equations, say (1) and (3), and eliminate again. We multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (3) to obtain Equation (5).  We now form a system with our new Equations (4) and (5).  Finally, we eliminate one of the remaining variables to obtain an equation in a single variable. We choose to eliminate , so we add 4 times Equation (4) to times Equation (5) to obtain Equation (6).  Now we are ready to form a triangular system. We choose one of the original equations (in three variables), one of the equations from our system, and our final equation in one variable. We choose Equations (1), (4), and (6).  This new system has the same solutions as the original system, and we can solveit by back-substitution. We first solve Equation (6) to find . Substituting 3 for in Equation (4), we find  So . Finally, we substitute for and for into Equation (1) to find  The solution to the system is the ordered triple . You should verify that this triple satisfies all three of the original equations.  We summarize the method for solving a 3x3 linear system as follows.  Steps for Solving a 3x3 Linear System linear system 3x3 system of equations 3x3 Gaussian reduction system of equations Gaussian reduction   Clear each equation of fractions and put it in standard form.  Choose two of the equations and eliminate one of the variables by forming a linear combination.  Choose a different pair of equations and eliminate the same variable.  Form a system with the equations found in steps (2) and (3). Eliminate one of the variables from this system by using a linear combination.  Form a triangular system by choosing among the previous equations. Use back-substitution to solve the triangular system.   QuickCheck 3 Suppose you eliminate from two equations as Step 2 of Gaussian reduction. What should you do for Step 3?   Form a triangular system.  Eliminate either or .  Eliminate again from a different pair of equations.  Substitute the value for into the equations.   Practice 2 Use Gaussian reduction to solve the system Follow the steps:  Step 1: Clear the fractions from Equation (2).   Step 2: Eliminate from Equations (1) and (2).  Step 3: Eliminate from Equations (1) and (3).  Step 4: Eliminate from your new system.  Step 5: Form a triangular system and solve by back-substitution.   For help on clearing fractions, see Section 2.4.2 of the Toolkit.   Inconsistent and Dependent Systems  If, at any step in forming linear combinations, we obtain an equation of the form then the system is inconsistent and has no solution. If we don’t obtain such an equation, but we do obtain one of the form then the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions. system of equations inconsistent system of equations dependent  To review the inconsistent and dependent systems, see Section 2.3 of the text.  Solve the systems.     To eliminate from Equations (1) and (2), we multiply Equation (1) by and add the result to Equation (2). Because the resulting equation has no solution, the system is inconsistent .  To eliminate from Equations (1) and (3), we multiply Equation (1) by and add Equation (3). Because the resulting equation vanishes, the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions.   Practice 3 Decide whether the system is inconsistent, dependent, or consistent and independent. Inconsistent  QuickCheck 4 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   If a system is dependent, it has no solutions.  The equation has no solution.  If a 3x3 system is dependent, all three equations are the same.  Gaussian reduction will reveal whether a system is dependent or inconsistent.    Applications  Here are some problems that can be modeled by a system of three linear equations.  One angle of a triangle measures less than twice the second angle, and the third angle is greater than the sum of the first two. Find the measure of each angle.   Step 1:  We represent the measure of each angle by a separate variable.  Step 2:  We write the conditions stated in the problem as three equations.   Step 3:  We follow the steps for solving a linear system.  1. We write the three equations in standard form.   2 3. Because Equation (1) has no -term, it will be most efficient to eliminate from Equations (2) and (3). We add these two equations.  4. We form a system from Equations (1) and (4). We add the two equations to eliminate the variable , yielding  5. We form a triangular system using Equations (2), (1), and (5). We use back-substitution to complete the solution. We divide both sides of Equation (5) by to find . We substitute for in Equation (1) and solve for to find We substitute for and for in Equation (3) to find  Step 4:  The angles measure 52°, 28°, and 100°.   For help writing an equation in standard form, see Section 2.4.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4 A farmer has 1300 acres on which to plant wheat, corn, and soybeans. The seed costs $6 for an acre of wheat, $4 for an acre of corn, and $5 for an acre of soybeans. An acre of wheat requires 5 acre-feet of water during the growing season, while an acre of corn requires 2 acre-feet and an acre of soybeans requires 3 acre-feet.

  "body": " Linear Inequalities in Two Variables  To conclude this chapter on applications of linear models, we look at some uses of linear inequalities and their graphs.  Graphs of Inequalities in Two Variables  Recall that a linear inequality can have many solutions. For example, the solutions of are all numbers less than . So it should not be surprising that inequalities in two variables also have many solutions.  To review solving linear inequalities, see Section 2.5.1 of the Toolkit.  A solution solution to an inequality in two variables is an ordered pair of numbers that satisfies the inequality.  Find a solution to the inequality for  For , we have You can check that any value of greater than or equal to 8000 provides a solution when . For example, is a solution because .   We can gain some insight into the nature of the solutions if we rewrite the inequality as This inequality says that for each -value, we must choose points with -values greater than or equal to . As we saw in above, when , the solutions have -values greater than or equal to 8000. Solutions for , , and are shown in the figure. Do you see a pattern emerging?  linear inequality   The graph of the inequality must show all the points whose coordinates are solutions. We found some solutions to the inequality in above by choosing a value for and solving for . A more efficient way to find all the solutions of the inequality is to start with the graph of the corresponding equation  linear inequality, 2 variables  The graph is a straight line with slope . Any point above this line has a -coordinate greater than and hence satisfies the inequality. Thus, the graph of the inequality includes all the points on or above the line , as shown by the shaded region in the figure. Of course, the shaded points are also solutions to the original inequality, .  For example, the point is a solution, because On the other hand, the point does not lie in the shaded region because its coordinates do not satisfy the inequality.  So, just as the solutions of a linear inequality in one variable can be a portion of the -axis, the solutions of a linear inequality in two variables can be a portion of the -plane.  Practice 1  Find one -value that satisfies the inequality for each of the -values in the table.            Graph the line . Then plot your solutions from part (a) on the same grid.             (Many answers are possible.)  linear inequality in 2 variables    Finding the Solutions  Let us organize our observations from the discussion above to develop a method for finding the solutions of a linear inequality.  A linear inequality linear inequality inequality linear can be written in the form The solutions consist of the line and a half-plane half-plane on one side of that line. We shade the half-plane to show that all its points are included in the solution set.  To decide which side of the line to shade, we can solve the inequality for in terms of . If we obtain then we shade the half-plane above the line. If the inequality is equivalent to then we shade the half-plane below the line.   Graph the solutions of  First we solve the inequality for .   Then we graph the corresponding line  with -intercept is and slope . Finally, we shade the half-plane below the line. The completed graph is shown at right.  linear inequality in two variables    To review graphing lines, see Section 2.5.2 of the Toolkit.  Be careful when isolating . Remember to reverse the direction of the inequality whenever we multiply or divide by a negative number. For example, the inequality is equivalent to   An inequality that uses or instead of or is called strict strict inequality inequality strict . The graph of a strict inequality includes only the half-plane and not the line. In that case we use a dashed line for the graph of the equation to show that it is not part of the solution.  Practice 2 Graph the solutions of the inequality .  4x-2y less than -8   QuickCheck 1 Complete each statement by filling in the blank.  The solutions of a linear inequality in two variables consist of a boundary line and a .  An inequality that uses or instead of or is called .  If we multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number we must the direction of the inequality symbol.  The shaded region shows all the of the inequality.    Using a Test Point  A second method for graphing inequalities does not require us to solve for . Because all the solutions lie on one side of the boundary line, we only need to find one soution! Once we have graphed the boundary line, we can decide which half-plane to shade by using a test point test point for inequalities . The test point can be any point that is not on the boundary line itself.  Graph the solutions of the inequality  First, we graph the line , as shown below. We will use the intercept method. The intercepts are and , so we sketch the boundary line through those points.  Next, we choose a test point. Because does not lie on the line, we choose it as our test point. We substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality to obtain   Because this is a true statement, is a solution of the inequality. Since all the solutions lie on the same side of the boundary line, we shade the half-plane that contains the test point. In this example, the boundary line is a dashed line because the original inequality was strict.  strict linear inequality in two variables   Here is a summary of our test point method for graphing inequalities.  To Graph an Inequality Using a Test Point graph graphing an inequality using a test point test point for inequalities  Graph the corresponding equation to obtain the boundary line.  Choose a test point that does not lie on the boundary line.  Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality.  If the resulting statement is true, shade the half-plane that includes the test point.  If the resulting statement is false, shade the half-plane that does not include the test point.   If the inequality is strict, make the boundary line a dashed line.   We can choose any point for the test point as long as it does not lie on the boundary line. We chose in because the coordinates are easy to substitute into the inequality. Because is a solution, we shaded the half-plane including that point. If, for example, we choose as the test point, we find which is a false statement. Thus, is not a solution to the inequality, so the solutions must lie on the other side of the boundary line. Note that using as the test point gives us the same solutions we found in .  Practice 3 Graph the solutions of the inequality   Graph the line (Use the slope-intercept method.)  Choose a test point. (Do not choose !)  Decide which side of the line to shade.  Should the boundary line be dashed or solid?   We cannot choose a test point that lies on the boundary line. In Practice 3 above, we cannot use as a test point, because it lies on the line In this case, we should choose some other point, such as or .   A simple example of of our method involves horizontal and vertical lines. Recall that the equation of a vertical line vertical line has the form where is a constant, and a horizontal line horizontal line has an equation of the form Even though only one variable appears in the equation , if we think of it as , it represents a line in the plane. Similarly, the inequality may represent the inequality in two variables Its graph is then a region in the plane.  Graph in the plane.  First, we graph the equation ; its graph is a vertical line. Because the origin does not lie on this line, we can use it as a test point. Substitute for (there is no ) into the inequality to obtain   Because this is a false statement, we shade the half-plane that does not contain the origin. We see that the graph of the inequality contains all points whose -coordinates are greater than or equal to . (Or we can use common sense to shade all points with -coordinates greater than or equal to .)  graph of x greater or equal to 2 in the plane   Practice 4 Graph in the plane.   Systems of Inequalities system of inequalities inequality system of   Some applications are best described by a system of two or more inequalities. The solutions to a system of inequalities include all points that are solutions to every inequality in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system. For example, the figure at right shows the solutions of the system  system of two inequalities   Laura's diet prescribes 500 milligrams of calcium from a combination of broccoli, at 160 milligrams per serving, and zucchini, at 30 milligrams per serving. Draw a graph representing the possible combinations of broccoli and zucchini that fulfill Laura’s calcium requirements.   Step 1  Number of servings of broccoli:  Number of servings of zucchini:  Step 2  To get enough calcium, Laura must choose and so that It makes no sense to consider negative values of or of , since Laura cannot eat a negative number of servings. Thus, we have two more inequalities to satisfy:  Step 3   We graph all three inequalities on the same axes. The inequalities and restrict the solutions to lie in the first quadrant. The solutions common to all three inequalities are shown at right.  system of three inequalities   Step 4  Laura can choose any combination of broccoli and zucchini represented by points in the shaded region. For example, the point is a solution to the system of inequalities, so Laura could choose to eat servings of broccoli and serving of zucchini.

We cannot choose a test point that lies on .  The soution set of a system of inequalities is the of the solutions to each inequality in the system.  The corner points of the solution set are called the .  The graph of is the set of all points that lie the boundary line.     Problem Set 2.5  Warm Up  Ivana owns two hotels, that earn annual profits of and dollars, respectively. She would like her total annual profit from the two hotels to be (exactly) $10,000.   Fill in the table with some possible values for and , in thousands of dollars. (Note that it is possible for one of the hotels to sustain a loss, or negative profit.)                grid  Plot the ordered pairs from your table on the grid.  Write an equation that describes this problem.  Graph all solutions of the equation.                 grid    See above.   Now suppose that Ivana would like her profit to be greater than $10,000.  List four pairs of values for and that achieve this goal.                Plot the four points on the grid in Problem 1.  Write an inequality for and that describes this situation.  Shade in the region that contains all solutions of the inequality. Note that all the solutions of the inequality lie on one side of the line.    Explain how the graph of the equation in Problem 1 is different from the graph of the inequality in Problem 2.  Describe the graph of the inequality .   The graph of the equation is a line, and the graph of the inequality is a half-plane. The line is the boundary of the half-plane but is not included in the solution to the inequality.  The graph of includes both the line and the half-plane of the corresponding strict inequality.   Graph the solutions of the inequality  Write the equation in slope-intercept form  Use the slope-intercept method to graph the line.    Use a test point to locate the solutions of the inequality. We can use any point for a test point, as long as it does not lie on the line! We'll use . Plot this point on your graph. Use algebra to decide whether is a solution of the inequality  Which side of the line includes all the solutions of the inequality? Shade that side of the line.

We can use interpolation or extrapolation to make estimates and predictions.  If we extrapolate too far beyond the known data, we may get unreasonable results.  A solution to a linear system is an ordered pair that satisfies both equations.  A solution to a linear system is a point where the two graphs intersect.  The graphs of the equations in an inconsistent system are parallel lines and hence to do not intersect.  The graphs of the two equations in a dependent system are the same line.  If a company's revenue exactly equals its costs (so that their profit is zero), we say that the business venture will break even .  For solving a linear system, the substitution method is easier if one of the variables in one of the equations has a coefficient of or .  If a linear combination of the equations in a system results in an equation of the form then the system is inconsistent . If an equation of the form results, then the system is dependent  The point-slope form is useful when we know the rate of change and one point on the line.  The solutions of the linear inequality  consists of the line and a half-plane on one side of that line.  To Graph an Inequality Using a Test Point   Graph the corresponding equation to obtain the boundary line.  Choose a test point that does not lie on the boundary line.  Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality.  If the resulting statement is true, shade the half-plane that includes the test point.  If the resulting statement is false, shade the half-plane that does not include the test point.  If the inequality is strict, make the boundary line a dashed line.   The solutions to a system of inequalities includes all points that are solutions to all the inequalities in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system.  A solution to an equation in three variables is an ordered triple of numbers that satisfies the equation.  To solve a linear system, we use linear combinations to reduce the system to triangular form , and then use back-substitution to find the solutions.

Now we'll consider second-degree equations, or quadratic quadratic equation equation quadratic second-degree quadratic equation second-degree quadratic equations. A quadratic equation includes the square of the variable.  Here are some examples.  Some familiar geometric formulas are quadratic equations, such as the formula for the area of a circle, .  Quadratic Equation  A quadratic equation can be written in the standard form where and are constants, and is not zero.  QuickCheck 1 Which of the following equations are quadratic?         We would like to be able to solve quadratic equations, use them in applications, and graph quadratic equations in two variables. Let's begin by considering some simple examples.   Graphs of Quadratic Equations quadratic equation graph of   The simplest quadratic equation in two variables is Its graph is not a straight line, but a curve called a parabola parabola , shown in the figure. You can verify the table of values below for this parabola.                      standard parabola  Be careful when squaring negative numbers. To evaluate the square of a negative number on a calculator, we must enclose the number in parentheses to show that the negative sign is included in the expression to be squared. For example,  Graph the parabola  We make a table of values and plot the points. The graph is shown below.                      parabola   To review evaluating quadratic expressions, see Section 3.1.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Graph the parabola on the same grid in the Example above. parabola   Solving Quadratic Equations  How can we solve a quadratic equation? Consider the equation First, we can solve it graphically. Look again at the graph of from Example 1. quadratic equation solving by graphing  parabola and y=5  We would like to find the -values that make . The horizontal line intersects the graph at two points with -coordinate 5, and their -coordinates are the solutions of the equation. Thus, there are two solutions, namely and .  Algebraically, we solve the equation as follows.  First, we isolate the variable. We add 4 to both sides, yielding .  Because is squared in this equation, we perform the opposite operation, or take square roots, square root square root root square root in order to solve for .  The solutions are and , as we saw on the graph.  For more on square roots, see Section 3.1.2 of the Toolkit.  Notice that we have found two solutions for this quadratic equation, whereas linear equations have at most one solution. (Sometimes they have no solution at all.) We shall see that every quadratic equation has two solutions, which may be equal. The solutions may also be complex numbers, complex number which we'll study in Chapter 4.  Solve the equation graphically and algebraically.  The figure shows the graph of   parabola and y=8  We would like to find the -values that make . The horizontal line intersects the graph at two points with -coordinates approximately and . These are the solutions of the equation.  Algebraically, we solve the equation as follows.  First, we isolate the variable. We add 7 to both sides, then multiply by 2, yielding .  Because is squared in this equation, we perform the opposite operation, or take square roots, in order to solve for .  We use a calculator to find that is approximately 5.477, or about 5.5, as we saw on the graph.   Many square roots are irrational numbers , which means that their decimal form never ends. When we round off the decimal form we have an approximation to the square root, but not its exact value. It is important to make a distinction betweeen exact values and decimal approximations.  For the example above, the exact solutions are .  The values from the calculator, , are decimal approximations to the solutions, rounded to thousandths.  QuickCheck 2 Which solutions are exact values, and which are approximations?        Extracting Roots  We can now solve quadratic equations of the form , where the linear term is missing, by isolating on one side of the equation, and then taking the square root of each side. This method for solving quadratic equations is called extraction of roots . extraction of roots quadratic equation  Extraction of Roots extraction of roots quadratic equation solving by extraction of roots  To solve a quadratic equation of the form   Isolate on one side of the equation.  Take the square root of each side.  Practice 2 Solve by extracting roots  In the next Example, we compare the steps for evaluating a quadratic expression and for solving a quadratic equation .  Tux the cat falls off a tree branch 20 feet above the ground. His height seconds later is given by .  How high is Tux above the ground 0.5 second later?  How long does Tux have to get in position to land on his feet before he reaches the ground?    We evaluate the formula for . We substitute for into the formula, and simplify. Tux is 16 feet above the ground after 0.5 second. You can also use your calculator to simplify the expression for by entering        ENTER   We would like to find the value of when Tux's height, , is zero. We substitute into the equation to obtain To solve this equation we use extraction of roots. We first isolate on one side of the equation. Next, we take the square root of both sides of the equation to find Only the positive solution makes sense here, so Tux has approximately 1.12 seconds to be in position for landing.   A graph of the Tux's height after seconds is shown below. The points corresponding to parts (a) and (b) are labeled.  graph    Geometric Formulas  The formulas for the volume and surface area of some everyday objects, such as cylinders and cones, involve quadratic expressions. We can use extraction of roots to solve problems involving these objects.  Formulas for Volume and Surface Area geometric formulas surface area of a sphere surface area of a cylinder surface area of a cone surface area of a pyramid  volume of a sphere volume of a cylinder volume of a cone volume of a pyramid  3D Objects   The volume of a can of soup is 582 cubic centimeters, and its height is 10.5 centimeters. What is the radius of the can, to the nearest tenth of a centimeter?  The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula . We substitute for and for , then solve for . The radius of the can is approximately 4.2 centimeters.  For more examples using geometric formulas, see Section 3.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3 The glass pyramid at the Louvre in Paris has a square base, is 21.64 meters tall, and encloses a volume of 9049.68 cubic meters. Use the formula to find the length of the base. Round your answer to hundredths. 35.42 m   Solving Formulas  Sometimes it is useful to solve a formula for one variable in terms of the others. You might want to know what radius you need to build cones of various fixed volumes. In that case, it is more efficient to solve the volume formula for in terms of .  The formula gives the volume of a cone in terms of its height and radius. Solve the formula for in terms of and .  Because the variable we want is squared, we use extraction of roots. First, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction. Because the radius of a cone must be a positive number, we use only the positive square root: .  Practice 4 Find a formula for the radius of a circle in terms of its area, .  Hint: Start with the formula for the area of a circle:   Solve for in terms of .  QuickCheck 3 Match each quantity with the appropriate units.    Height of a cylinder  Volume of a cone  Surface area of a sphere  Area of a triangle    Square meters  Feet  Cubic centimeters  Kilograms    More Extraction of Roots extraction of roots  We can also use extraction of roots to solve quadratic equations of the form We start by isolating the squared expression, .  Solve the equation .  First, we isolate the perfect square, . This gives us two equations for , The solutions are and . You can check that both of these solutions satisfy the original equation.   Practice 5 Solve by extracting roots.   Give your answers as exact values.  Find approximations for the solutions to two decimal places.    or   QuickCheck 4 True or false.  The first step in extraction of roots is to take square roots.  The solutions of a quadratic equation are always of the form .  Your calculator gives exact decimal values for square roots of integers.  The coefficients of a quadratic equation are called parabolas.    An Application: Compound Interest  Many savings accounts offer interest compounded annually: compound interest compound interest principal at the end of each year the interest earned is added to the principal, and the interest for the next year is computed on this larger sum of money. After years, the amount of money in the account is given by the formula where is the original principal and is the interest rate, expressed as a decimal fraction.  Carmella invests $3000 in an account that pays an interest rate compounded annually.  Write an expression for the amount of money in Carmella's account after two years.  What interest rate would be necessary for Carmella's account to grow to $3500 in two years?    We use the formula with and . Carmella's account balance will be  We substitute for in the equation. This is a quadratic equation in the variable , which we can solve by extraction of roots. First, we isolate the perfect square. Because the interest rate must be a positive number, we discard the negative solution. Carmella needs an account with interest rate , or over 8%, in order to have an account balance of $3500 in two years.   The formula for compound interest also applies to calculating the effects of inflation.

  "body": "Intercepts, Solutions, and Factors factor  In the last section, we used extraction of roots to solve quadratic equations of the form But this technique will not work on quadratic equations that also include a linear term, . Recall that the most general type of quadratic equation looks like Here is an example.  Suppose a baseball player pops up, that is, she hits the baseball straight up into the air. The height, , of the baseball after seconds is given by a formula from physics. This formula takes into account the initial speed of the ball (64 feet per second) and its height when it was hit (4 feet). The graph of this equation is shown below.  baseball popup  We would like to know when the baseball was exactly 52 feet high. To find out, we must solve the equation where we have substituted 52 for the height, . We can use the graph to solve this equation, by finding points with -coordinate 52. You can see that there are two such points, with -coordinates 1 and 3, so the baseball is 52 feet high at 1 second, and again on the way down at 3 seconds.  Can we solve the equation algebraically? Not with the techniques we know, because there are two terms containing the variable , and they cannot be combined. We will need a new method. To find this method, we are going to study the connection between:  the factors of ,  the solutions of the quadratic equation and  the -intercepts x -intercept of the graph of .  If you would like to review multiplying binomials using the \"FOIL\" method, see Section 3.2.1 of the Toolkit.   Zero-Factor Principle zero-factor principle  The method we will learn now is not like extraction of roots, or like solving linear equations, where we \"undid\" in reverse order each operation performed on the variable, like peeling an onion. This new method will seem less direct. It relies on applying a property of our number system.  Can you multiply two numbers together and obtain a product of zero? Only if one of the two numbers happens to be zero. (Try it yourself.)  Zero-Factor Principle zero-factor principle  The product of two factors equals zero if and only if one or both of the factors equals zero. In symbols,   QuickCheck 1 Fill in the blanks.   If the sum of two numbers is zero, the numbers must be .  If a fraction equals zero, the must be zero.  If the product of two numbers is zero, one of the numbers must be .  If the divisor in a quotient is zero, the quotient is .   Here is the simplest possible application of the Zero-Factor Principle (ZFP): For what value(s) of is the equation true? You could divide both sides by 3, but you can also see that the product can equal zero only if one of its factors is zero, so must be zero!  The ZFP is true even if the numbers and are represented by algebraic expressions, such as or . For example, if then it must be true that either or This is how we can use the ZFP to solve quadratic equations.  Solve the equation  We can factor the expression , and write the equation as  Now it is in the form , with and , so the ZFP tells us that either or . We solve each of these equations. Once again we see that a quadratic equation has two solutions. You can check that both of these values satisfy the original equation.  To review factoring quadratic trinaomials, see Section 3.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Solve the equation or   X-Intercepts of a Parabola  Recall that the -intercept x -intercept of a line is the point where , or where the line crosses the -axis. We find the -intercept by setting in the equation of the line, and solving for . We can find the -intercepts of a parabola the same way.  Find the -intercepts of the graph of  To find the -intercepts of the graph, we set and solve the equation But this is the same equation we solved in the last Example , because The solutions of that equation were and , so the -intercepts of the graph are and . You can see this by graphing the equation on your calculator, as shown in the figure.  parabola with x-intercepts   We can state a general result: The -intercepts of the graph of are the solutions of the equation So we can always solve a quadratic equation to find the -intercepts of a parabola (if there are any).  And we can use this relationship the other way round, too: If we know the -intercepts of the graph of we also know the solutions of the equation .  Practice 2 Use technology to graph the equation and find the -intercepts of the graph. Use your answers to solve the equation Check your solutions by applying the ZFP. or   Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring factoring solve a quadratic equation by quadratic equation solve by factoring  Now we'll consider some other quadratic equations. Before we apply the ZFP, we must write the equation so that one side is zero.  Solve  First, we write the equation in standard form. Now we factor the left side to obtain The solutions are and .  When we apply the zero-factor principle, one side of the equation must be zero. For example, to solve the equation it is incorrect to set each factor equal to 15! (There are many ways that the product of two numbers can equal 15; it is not necessary that one of the numbers be 15.)  We must first simplify the left side and write the equation in standard form. (The correct solutions are and ; check that you can find these solutions.)  We summarize the factoring method for solving quadratic equations as follows.  To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring factoring solve a quadratic equation by quadratic equation solve by factoring    Write the equation in standard form.  Factor the left side of the equation.  Apply the zero-factor principle: Set each factor equal to zero.  Solve each equation. There are two solutions (which may be equal).   Practice 3 Solve by factoring:  Hint: Begin by multiplying out each side of the equation. or  QuickCheck 2 Which technique, extracting roots or factoring, is better-suited to each equation?           Now we can use factoring to solve the opening problem in this section.  The height, , of a baseball seconds after being hit is given by When will the baseball reach a height of 64 feet?  We substitute for in the formula, and solve for . There are two solutions. At seconds, the ball reaches a height of 64 feet on the way up, and at seconds, the ball is 64 feet high on its way down.   In the Example above, the factor of 4 does not affect the solutions of the equation at all. You can understand why this is true by looking at some graphs. Use technology to graph the equation in the window Notice that when , or . These two points are the -intercepts of the graph. Now on the same window graph as shown below.  graph  This graph has the same -values when . The factor of 4 makes the graph \"skinnier,\" but does not change the location of the -intercepts.  Practice 4  Solve by factoring .  Solve by factoring .  Graph and together in the window and locate the horizontal intercepts on each graph.  and  QuickCheck 3 Match each equation with its solutions.                An Application  Here is another example of how quadratic equations arise in applications.  The size of a rectangular computer monitor screen is taken to be the length of its diagonal. If the length of the screen should be 3 inches greater than its width, what are the dimensions of a 15-inch monitor?  We express the two dimensions of the screen in terms of a single variable: We apply the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation : To solve this equation, we begin by simplifying the left side. Because the width of the screen cannot be a negative number, the width is 9 inches, and the length is inches.  To review the Pythagorean theorem, see Section 3.1.4 of the Toolkit.  Practice 5 Francine is designing the layout for a botanical garden. The plan includes a square herb garden, with a path 5 feet wide through the center of the garden, as shown at right. To include all the species of herbs, the planted area must be 300 square feet. Find the dimensions of the herb garden.  garden 20 feet by 20 feet   More About Solutions of Quadratic Equations quadratic equation solutions of  As we have seen in ehe examples above, the solutions of the quadratic equation are and . This is called the factored form factored form factored form quadratic equation of the quadratic equation. Thus, if we know the two solutions of a quadratic equation, we can work backwards to reconstruct the equation.  Find a quadratic equation whose solutions are and .  Each solution corresponds to a factor of the equation, so the equation must look like this: or, simplifying: We multiply the factors together to obtain This is an equation that works, but we can make a \"nicer\" one if we clear the fractions. We can multiply both sides of the equation by 2. We know that multiplying by a constant does not change the solutions of the equation. By factoring, we can check that this equation really does have the given solutions. From here, you can see that the solutions are indeed and .   Practice 6 Find a quadratic equation with integer coefficients whose solutions are and .   A quadratic equation in one variable always has two solutions. In some cases, the solutions may be equal. For example, the equation can be solved by factoring as follows: Both of these equations have solution . We say that 1 is a solution of multiplicity two multiplicity quadratic equation multiplicity , meaning that it occurs twice as a solution of the quadratic equation.  QuickCheck 4 True or false.   We find the -intercepts of a graph by setting .  If is a solution of a quadratic equation, then is a factor of the left side in standard form.  We can factor a constant from both sides of a quadratic equation without changing its solutions.  To solve a quadratic equation by factoring, we should factor each side of the equation.    Problem Set 3.2  Warm Up  For Problems 1-4, write each product as a polynomial in simplest form.                   Factor if possible.         cannot be factored  Solve if possible.

Introduction  The graph of any quadratic equation is a parabola parabola (if ). In this section we'll make a systematic study of the parabolas we've met earlier in the chapter. Some typical parabolas are shown below.  two parabolas with labeled features  To begin, notice that these parabolas share certain features.  The graph has either a highest point (if the parabola opens downward, as in figure (a) or a lowest point (if the parabola opens upward, as in figure (b). This high or low point is called the vertex vertex of a parabola of the graph.  The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line, called the axis of symmetry axis of symmetry parabola axis of symmetry axis of symmetry axis of symmetry parabola symmetry axis of symmetry , that runs through the vertex.  A parabola has a -intercept y -intercept , and it may have zero, one, or two -intercepts x -intercept .  If there are two -intercepts, they are equidistant from the axis of symmetry.   The values of the constants , , and determine the location and orientation of the parabola. We'll consider each of these constants separately.  QuickCheck 1 Which point on a parabola always lies on the axis of symmetry?   The Graph of  Use your calculator to graph the following three equations in the standard window, as shown below:  3 parabolas  You can see that the graph of is narrower than the basic parabola, and the graph of is wider. As increases, the graph of increases faster than the basic parabola, and the graph of increases more slowly. Compare the corresponding -values for the three graphs shown in the table.                        For each -value, the points on the graph of are higher than the points on the basic parabola, while the points on the graph of are lower. Multiplying by a positive constant greater than 1 stretches the graph vertically, and multiplying by a positive constant less than 1 squashes the graph vertically.  What about negative values for ? Consider the graphs of  parabolas  We see that multiplying by a negative constant reflects the graph about the -axis. These parabolas open downward.  The Graph of   The parabola opens upward if  The parabola opens downward if  The magnitude of determines how wide or narrow the parabola is.  The vertex, the -intercepts, and the -intercept all coincide at the origin.   Sketch by hand a graph of each quadratic equation.     Both equations have the form . The graph of opens upward because , and the graph of opens downward because .  To make a reasonable sketch by hand, it is enough to plot a few guidepoints ; the points with -coordinates and are easy to compute.   two vertically scaled parabolas                     We sketch parabolas through each set of guidepoints, as shown at left.   QuickCheck 2 True or false.   If , the graph of is wider than the basic parabola.  The vertex of a parabola lies on its axis of symmetry.  If the -intercept is negative, the parabola opens downward.  A parabola may have one, two, or three -intercepts.   Practice 1  Match each parabola with its equation. The basic parabola is shown in black.         basic parabola and four vertically scaled parabolas  III  II  I  IV    The Graph of  Next, we consider the effect of the constant term, , on the graph. Compare the graphs of  vertically shifted parabolas  The graph of is shifted upward four units compared to the basic parabola, and the graph of is shifted downward four units. Look at the table, which shows the -values for the three graphs.                        Each point on the graph of is four units higher than the corresponding point on the basic parabola, and each point on the graph of is four units lower.

If the solutions are not integers, the expression may be very difficult to factor. For example, the equation cannot be solved easily by either of these methods. In this section we learn a method that will solve any quadratic equation.  Squares of Binomials  We can use extraction of roots to solve equations of the form where the left side of the equation includes the square of a binomial, or a perfect square perfect square . It turns out that we can write any quadratic equation in this form.  Study the following squares of binomials. binomial square of    Square of binomial      1.      2.      3.      In each case, the square of the binomial is a quadratic trinomial quadratic trinomial , The coefficient of the linear term, , is twice the constant in the binomial, and the constant term of the trinomial, , is its square.  For more examples of squares of binomials, see Section 3.4.1 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 1 What is the linear term of ?  We would like to reverse the process and write a quadratic expression as the square of a binomial. For example, what constant term can we add to to produce a perfect square trinomial? Compare the expression to the formula above: We see that , so We substitute these values for and into the equation to find You can check that in the resulting trinomial, the constant term is equal to the square of one-half the coefficient of  . In other words, we can find the constant term by taking one-half the coefficient of and then squaring the result. Adding a constant term obtained in this way is called completing the square completing the square .

They have feet of picket fence and would like the total area of the playground to be square feet. Can they enclose the playground with the fence they have, and if so, what should the dimensions of the playground be?  two fenced rectangles against wall   Suppose the width of the play area is feet. Because there are three sections of fence along the width of the play area, that leaves feet of fence for its length.  The area of the play area should be square feet, so we have the equation This is a quadratic equation. We use the distributive law and write the equation in standard form. The left side of this equation cannot be factored, so we use the quadratic formula with , , and . When we evalute this last expression, we get two different positive values for the width of the play area, or . Both values give solutions to the problem. To find the length of the playground in each case, we substitute into   If the width of the play area is feet, the length is , or feet.  If the width is feet, the length is , or feet.

For example, when we try to solve the equation , we find Although square roots square root of a negative real number square root of a negative real number imaginary number root square root of negative numbers such as are not real numbers, they occur frequently in mathematics and its applications. Mathematicians in the sixteenth century gave them the name imaginary numbers imaginary number , which reflected the mistrust with which they were viewed at the time. Today, however, such numbers are well understood and are used routinely by scientists and engineers.  To help us work with imaginary numbers, we define a new number, i , the imaginary unit imaginary unit i , whose square is .  Imaginary Unit i   With this new number we define the principal square root of any negative real number as follows.  Imaginary Numbers imaginary number  If ,  Thus, the square root of any negative real number can be written as the product of a real number and . Every negative real number has two imaginary square roots. For example, the square roots of are and . You can verify that     Practice 3 Simplify.         The solutions of many quadratic equations involve imaginary numbers.  Solve .  For this equation, , , and . We substitute these values into the quadratic formula to obtain We write the solutions as Because the solutions are not real numbers, the graph of has no -intercepts, as shown below.  parabola no x-intercepts   The sum of a real number and an imaginary number is called a complex number .  Practice 4 Use extraction of roots to solve . Write your answers as complex numbers. ,   Number of -Intercepts  The graph of the quadratic equation may have two, one, or no -intercepts, according to the number of distinct real-valued solutions of the equation . For example, consider the three graphs shown at right.  parabolas with zero, one, or two x-intercepts    The graph of has two -intercepts, because the equation has two real-valued solutions, and .  The graph of has only one -intercept, because the equation has only one (repeated) real-valued solution, .  The graph of has no -intercepts, because the equation has no real-valued solutions.  A closer look at the quadratic formula reveals useful information about the solutions of quadratic equations. The sign of the number under the radical determines how many solutions the equation has. For the three equations above, we calculate as follows:   From these examples, we see that the solutions of a quadratic equation always occur in conjugate pairs conjugate pair conjugate pair conjugate pair complex conjugate , For example, if we know that one solution of a particular quadratic equation is , the other solution must be . If one solution is , the other solution must be .  The expression , which appears under the radical in the quadratic formula, is called the discriminant discriminant , , of the equation. The value of the discriminant determines the nature of the solutions of the equation. In particular, if the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real-valued solutions; the solutions are complex numbers.  The Discriminant discriminant complex conjugate complex conjugate conjugate pair  The discriminant of a quadratic equation is   If , there are two unequal real solutions.  If , there is one solution of multiplicity two.  If , there are two complex conjugate solutions.  Use the discriminant to discover how many -intercepts the graph has.      We set and compute the discriminant for the resulting equation.  . The equation has two real, unequal solutions, and the graph has two -intercepts.  . The equation has no real solutions, so the graph has no -intercepts.  . The equation has one real solution of multiplicity two, and the graph has a single -intercept.  QuickCheck 3 True or False.  The discriminant is part of the quadratic formula.  We use the discriminant to calculate the solutions of a quadratic equation.  If the discriminant is negative, both -intercepts of the graph are negative.  If a quadratic equation won't factor, its graph has no -intercepts.   Practice 5 Use the discriminant to discover how many -intercepts the graph of each equation has.       None: the discriminant is negative.  One: the discriminant is 0.

What price should the theater group charge for a ticket to generate that revenue? How many tickets will the group sell at that price?    Finding the Vertex  The vertex of a parabola is an interesting point. It is the highest or lowest point on the parabola, and it \"anchors\" the parabola's position in the plane. As we saw in the Investigation, the vertex may represent the maximum or minimum possible value for a variable, so it has important implications for applications. Thus, it will be very useful to have a way to find the vertex easily.  In Section 3.3.5 we saw that the vertex of the graph of has -coordinate given by Now we'll see that the same formula holds for any parabola. Use your calculator to graph the two parabolas in the window   The graphs are shown at right. Now compare the two graphs. You should notice that:  The second graph is identical to the first, except shifted upward by 6 units.  For both graphs, the -coordinate of the vertex is .    two parabolas with same symmetry line  We see that the -coordinate of the vertex is not affected by an upward shift. The formula for the -coordinate of the vertex still holds.  Vertex of a Parabola parabola vertex of vertex of a parabola  For the graph of the -coordinate of the vertex is  Find the vertex of the graph of .   For this equation, , , and . The -coordinate of the vertex is given by To find the -coordinate of the vertex, we substitute into the equation. We can do this by hand to find So the coordinates of the vertex are . Alternatively, we can use the calculator to evaluate for . We enter   (-)          and press ENTER . The calculator returns the -value . Thus, the vertex is the point , which is the decimal equivalent of .  Practice 1  Find the vertex of the graph of .  Decide whether the vertex is a maximum point or a minimum point of the graph.  Hint: Does the parabola open up or down?    minimum   Once we know the vertex of a parabola, we can make a quick sketch of the graph.  Sketch a graph of  The vertex of the graph is given by The vertex is the point .  We set to find the -intercept, . Now, the axis of symmetry of the parabola is the vertical line that passes through its vertex. That line is , so the -intercept lies 1.5 units to the right of the axis. There must be another point on the parabola with the same -coordinate as the intercept but 1.5 units to the left of the axis. This point is .  By plotting the vertex, the -intercept, and its symmetric point, we can make a quick sketch of the parabola, as shown below.  parabola   If we need more accuracy in our graph, we can find and plot more points, including the -intercepts.   To review finding the -intercepts of a parabola, see Section 3.2.2 .  Practice 2 Find the vertex and sketch a graph of  parabola    Maximum or Minimum Values  Many quadratic models arise as the product of two variables, one of which increases while the other decreases. For example, in the Investigation for Section 3.3 we looked at the areas of different rectangles with the same perimeter. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and its width, or . If we require that the rectangle have a certain perimeter, then as we increase its length, we must also decrease its width.  Another example is the formula for the revenue revenue from sales of an item: Usually, when the price of an item increases, the number of items sold decreases.  Finding the maximum or minimum value for a variable expression is a common problem in applications. For example, if you own a company that manufactures blue jeans, you might like to know how much to charge for your jeans in order to maximize your revenue. As you increase the price of the jeans, your revenue may increase for a while. But if you charge too much for the jeans, consumers will not buy as many pairs, and your revenue may actually start to decrease. Is there some optimum price you should charge for a pair of jeans in order to achieve the greatest revenue?  Late Nite Blues finds that it can sell pairs of jeans per week if it charges dollars per pair. (Notice that as the price increases, the number of pairs of jeans sold decreases.)  Write an equation for the revenue as a function of the price of a pair of jeans.  Graph the function.  How much should Late Nite Blues charge for a pair of jeans in order to maximize its revenue?    Using the formula for revenue stated above, we find  We recognize the equation as quadratic, so the graph is a parabola. You can use your calculator to verify the graph below.  graph showing revenue from sales of jeans  As you can see from the graph, the maximum value of occurs at the vertex of the parabola. Thus, The revenue takes on its maximum value when , and the maximum value is . This means that Late Nite Blues should charge $20 for a pair of jeans in order to maximize revenue at $6000 a week.   If the equation relating two variables is quadratic, then the maximum or minimum value is easy to find: It is the value at the vertex. If the parabola opens downward, as in , there is a maximum value at the vertex. If the parabola opens upward, there is a minimum value at the vertex. maximum value minimum value maximum value parabola minimum value parabola  parabola maximum value quadratic equation maximum value  parabola minimum value quadratic equation minimum value  QuickCheck 1  To find the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic expression, we should:   Set and solve for .  Factor the expression.  Use the quadratic formula.  Find the vertex.   Practice 3 The Metro Rail service sells tickets each day when it charges dollars per ticket.   Write an equation for the revenue, , as a function of the price of a ticket.  What ticket price will return the maximum revenue?    $ , $    The Vertex Form for a Parabola parabola vertex form vertex form for a parabola quadratic equation vertex form  Because the vertex is such a useful tool, we introduce a new form for a quadratic equation. Consider the equation By expanding the squared expression and collecting like terms, we can rewrite the equation in standard form as  The vertex of this parabola is and its graph is shown at right.  parabola with vertex labeled  To review multiplying binomials, see Section 4.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Now notice that the coordinates of the vertex, , are apparent in the original equation; we don’t need to do any computation to find the vertex. This equation is an example of the vertex form vertex form for a quadratic function.  Vertex Form for a Quadratic Equation parabola vertex form vertex form for a quadratic equation  A quadratic equation can be written in the vertex form where the vertex of the graph is .  Find the vertex of the graph of . Is the vertex a maximum or a minimum point of the graph?  We compare the equation to the vertex form to see that the coordinates of the vertex are . For this equation, , so the parabola opens downward. The vertex is the maximum point of the graph.   To understand why the vertex form works, substitute into from to find which confirms that when , . Next, notice that if is any number except , the expression is negative, so . Therefore, is the maximum value for on the graph, so is the high point or vertex.  You can also rewrite in standard form and use the formula to confirm that the vertex is the point .  QuickCheck 2 Which of the following is the vertex form for a parabola with vertex ?        Practice 4  Find the vertex of the graph of .  Write the equation of the parabola in standard form.      Any quadratic equation in vertex form can be written in standard form by expanding, and any quadratic equation in standard form can be put into vertex form by completing the square.  completing the square  To review completing the square, see Section 3.4.2 .  Write the equation in vertex form and find the vertex of its graph.  We factor the lead coefficient, , from the variable terms, leaving a space to complete the square. Next, we complete the square inside parentheses. Take half the coefficient of and square the result: We must add to complete the square. However, we are really adding to the right side of the equation, so we must also subtract to compensate: The expression inside parentheses is now a perfect square, and the vertex form is The vertex of the parabola is .  Practice 5 Write the equation in vertex form, and find the vertex of its graph.  Hint:  Factor from the variable terms.  Complete the square inside parentheses.  Subtract outside parentheses.  Write the vertex form.  ;   Using the Vertex Form  We can make a quick sketch of a parabola whose equation is given in vertex form.  Graph the equation  The vertex is the point . We can find the -intercept by setting . The -intercept is the point . The axis of symmetry is the vertical line , and there is a symmetric point equidistant from the axis, namely . We plot these three points and sketch the parabola through them.  parabola  To see more examples of sketching from the vertex form, see Section 4.2.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6 Find the vertex, the -intercept, and the -intercepts of , and sketch its graph. parabola  If we know the vertex of a parabola and one other point, we can use the vertex form to find its equation.  When Andre practices free-throws at the park, the ball leaves his hands at a height of 7 feet, and reaches the vertex of its trajectory 10 feet away at a height of 11 feet.  Find a quadratic equation for the ball's trajectory.  Do you think Andre's free-throw would score on a regulation basketball court, where the hoop is 15 feet from the shooter and 10 feet high?    If Andre's feet are at the origin, then the vertex of the ball's trajectory is the point , and its -intercept is . We start with the vertex form for a parabola. We use the point to find the value of . The equation of the trajectory is .  parabola  We'd like to know if the point is on the trajectory of Andre's free-throw. We substitute into the equation. From our computations, we see that the point is indeed on the trajectory. However, because Andre's shot will probably hit the backboard just where the hoop attaches and bounce off, so it is unlikely that his shot will score.     For more examples of finding the vertex form, see Section 4.2.3 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 3 Why do we need to know a second point besides the vertex to find the equation of a parabola?

In this section we'll see how to fit a quadratic equation to a collection of data points.   Finding a Quadratic Equation through Three Points quadratic equation find using three points  Every linear equation can be written in the form To find a specific line we must find values for the two parameters parameter quadratic equation parameters parameter quadratic equation (constants) and . We need two data points in order to find those two parameters. A quadratic equation, however, has three parameters, and : To find these parameters we need three data points.  To review points on a graph, see Section 4.3.1 of the Toolkit.  Find values for , , and so that the points , , and lie on the graph of .  We substitute the coordinates of each of the three points into the equation of the parabola to obtain three equations: or, equivalently, This is a system of three equations in the three unknowns , , and . To solve the system, we use Gaussian reduction. We first eliminate . We subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2) to obtain and then subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3) to get We now have a system of two linear equations in two variables: Next, we eliminate from Equations (4) and (5): we add times Equation (4) to times Equation (5) to get                            or . We substitute for in Equation (4) to find Finally, we substitute for and for in Equation (1) to find Thus, the equation of the parabola is The parabola and the three points are shown below.  parabola through-3 specified points   To review Gaussian reduction, see Section 4.3.3 . To see more examples of elimination, see Section 4.3.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 1 Fill in the blanks. To find the equation for a parabola:  We can use the formula if we know the and one other point.  We can use the formula if we know the and one other point.  Otherwise, we must know at least points on the graph.  In that case, we use to solve for the parameters of the equation.   Practice 1  Find the equation of a parabola that passes through the points , , and .  Plot the data points and sketch the parabola.     parabola      Applications  The simplest way to fit a parabola to a set of data points is to pick three of the points and find the equation of the parabola that passes through those three points.  Major Motors Corporation is testing a new car designed for in-town driving. The data below show the cost of driving the car at different speeds. The speeds, , are given in miles per hour, and the cost, , includes fuel and maintenance for driving the car miles at that speed.                  Find a possible quadratic model, that expresses in terms of .  When we plot the data, it is clear that the relationship between and is not linear, but it may be quadratic, as shown at right.  We will use the last three data points, , , and , to fit a parabola to the data. We would like to find the coefficients , , and of a parabola that includes the three data points. This gives us a system of equations:  scatterplot points following parabola shape    Eliminating from Equations (1) and (2) yields Equation (4), and eliminating from Equations (2) and (3) yields Equation (5). Eliminating from Equations (4) and (5) gives us  We substitute this value into Equation (4) to find , then substitute both values into Equation (1) to find .  Thus, our quadratic model is The graph of this equation, along with the data points, is shown at right.  parabola fitting nonlinear scatterplot   As was the case with linear regression, the graph of the regression equation may not pass through all of the data points, but it should be close to most of them.  Practice 2 The data below show Americans' annual per capita consumption of chicken for several years since 1985.    Year  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990   Pounds of chicken         Use the values for 1987 through 1989 to fit a quadratic equation to the data, where is measured in years since 1985.  What does your equation predict for per capita chicken consumption in 1990?  Sketch the graph of your equation and the given data. Does your model provide a good fit for the data?     65.7 lbs  scatterplot and parabola fit   QuickCheck 2 True or False   We can plot the data points to see what type of curve is appropriate as a model.  We write a system of equations in which the -coordinates of the data points are the unknown values.  A good regression equation will pass through all of the data points.  According to the model in the previous Example (involving a quadratic model for the cost of driving at different speeds), higher speeds always result in higher driving costs.    Using a Calculator for Quadratic Regression  We can use a graphing calculator or other technology to find an approximate quadratic fit for a set of data. The procedure is similar to the steps for linear regression.    Use your calculator to find a quadratic fit for the data in .  How many of the given data points actually lie on the graph of the quadratic approximation?    We press STAT  ENTER and enter the data under columns and , as shown below. Next, we calculate the quadratic regression equation and store it in by pressing STAT    VARS     ENTER .  The regression equation has the form , where , , and . Notice that , , and are all close to the values we computed in .  GC lists and GC quadratic regression output  Next, we will graph the data and the regression equation. We press Y= and select Plot1 , then press ZOOM  to see the graph shown below. The parabola seems to pass close to all the data points.  However, try using either the value feature or a table to find the -coordinates of points on the regression curve. By comparing these -coordinates with our original data points, we find that none of the given data points lies precisely on the parabola.  GC plot and GC table quadratic regression output   Practice 3 To test the effects of radiation, a researcher irradiated male mice with various dosages and bred them with unexposed female mice. The table below shows the fraction of fertilized eggs that survived, as a function of the radiation dosage. (Source: Strickberger, Monroe W., 1976)    Radiation (rems)          Relative survival of eggs           Enter the data into your calculator and create a scatterplot. Does the graph appear to be linear? Does it appear to be quadratic?  Fit a quadratic regression equation to the data and graph the equation on the scatterplot.   The graph appears to be quadratic.     Choosing an Appropriate Model  We must be careful that our data set gives a complete picture of the situation we want to model. A regression equation may fit a particular collection of data and still be a poor model if the rest of the data diverge from the regression graph.   GC graph showing a poor linear fit for quadratic data  In , suppose Major Motors had collected only the first three data points and fit a line through them, as shown at left. This regression line gives poor predictions for the cost of driving at 60 or 70 miles per hour.   Delbert records the height of the tip of the minute hand on the classroom’s clock at different times. The data are shown in the table, where time is measured in minutes since noon. (A negative time indicates a number of minutes before noon.) Find a quadratic regression equation for the data and use it to predict the height of the minute hand's tip at 40 minutes past noon. Do you believe this prediction is valid?    Time (minutes)              Height (feet)              We enter the time data under and the height data under . Then we calculate and store the quadratic regression equation in , as we did in . The regression equation is From either the graph of the regression equation or from the table (see figure below), we can see that the fit is not perfect, although the curve certainly fits the data better than any straight line could.  GC screens of graph and tables for quadratic fit  If we scroll down the table, we find that this equation predicts a height of approximately 4.08 feet at time 40 minutes. (See figure (c).) This is a preposterous estimate! The position of the minute hand at 40 minutes after noon should be the same as it was exactly one hour earlier (at 20 minutes before noon), when it was 7.50 feet.  Using the wrong type of function to fit the data is a common error in making predictions. In the Example above, we know that the minute hand of a clock repeats its position every 60 minutes. The graph of the height of its tip oscillates up and down, repeating the same pattern over and over. We cannot describe such a graph using either a linear or a quadratic function.   parabola fit on part of a periodic wave  The graph of the height is shown at left, along with the graph of our quadratic regression equation. You can see that the regression equation fits the actual curve only on a small interval.   Even though your calculator can always compute a regression equation,that equation is not necessarily appropriate for your data. Choosing a reasonable type of regression equation for a particular data set requires knowledge of different kinds of models and the physical or natural laws that govern the situation at hand.  QuickCheck 3 True or False   Your calculator can choose the correct type of regression equation for a data set.  It is only necessary to use the first and last data points to compute a regression equation.  A regression equation may fit some of the data but still be a poor model.  A good regression equation should fit all the data points exactly.   Practice 4 A speeding motorist slams on the brakes when she sees an accident directly ahead of her. The distance she has traveled seconds after braking is shown in the table.    Time (seconds)         Distance (feet)          Enter the data into your calculator and create a scatterplot.

City regulations require that fireworks at public gatherings explode higher than 800 feet above the ground. The mayor particularly wants to include the Freedom Starburst model, which is launched from the ground. Its height after t seconds is given by When should the Starburst explode in order to satisfy the safety regulation?  We can get an approximate answer to this question by looking at the graph of the rocket's height, shown below.  graph of fireworks height  We would like to know when the rocket's height is greater than 800 feet, or, in mathematical terms, for what values of is ? The answer to this question is the solution of the inequality Points on the graph with are shown in color, and the -coordinates of those points are marked on the horizontal axis. If the Freedom Starburst explodes at any of these times, it will satisfy the safety regulation.  From the graph, the safe time interval runs from approximately 4.25 seconds to 11.75 seconds after launch. The solution of the inequality is the set of all -values greater than 4.25 but less than 11.75.  The solution set in is called a compound inequality compound inequality inequality compound , because it involves more than one inequality symbol.

Use a graph to solve  We first write the inequality with zero on one side: . We would like to find points on the graph of that have -coordinates greater than or equal to zero.

Solving Quadratic Inequalities Algebraically quadratic inequality algebraic solution  Although a graph is very helpful in solving inequalities, it is not completely necessary. Every quadratic inequality can be put into one of the forms All we really need to know is whether the corresponding parabola opens upward or downward. Consider the parabolas shown below.  parabola opens up, the other opens down  The parabola in figure (a) opens upward. It crosses the -axis at two points, and . At these points, .  The graph lies below the -axis between and , so the solutions to the inequality lie between and .  The graph lies above the -axis for -values less than or greater than , so the solutions to the inequality are or .   If the parabola opens downward, as in figure (b), the situation is reversed. The solutions to the inequality lie between the -intercepts, and the solutions to lie outside the -intercepts.  From the graphs, we see that the -intercepts are the boundary points between the portions of the graph with positive -coordinates and the portions with negative -coordinates. To solve a quadratic inequality, we need only locate the -intercepts of the corresponding graph and then decide which intervals of the -axis produce the correct sign for .

The first two methods are faster, but they do not work on all equations. The last two methods work on any quadratic equation.  The imaginary unit , , is defined by .  The square root of any negative number can be written as the product of a real number (the square root of its absolute value) and .  The sum of a real number and an imaginary number is called a complex number .  The graph of the quadratic equation may have two, one, or no -intercepts, according to the number of distinct real-valued solutions of the equation .  The Discriminant  The discriminant of a quadratic equation is   If , there are two unequal real solutions.  If , there is one solution of multiplicity two.  If , there are two complex conjugate solutions.  Every quadratic equation has two solutions, which may be the same.  For the graph of , the -coordinate of the vertex is To find the -coordinate of the vertex, we substitute into the formula for the parabola.  Quadratic models may arise as the product of two variables.  The maximum or minimum of a quadratic equation occurs at the vertex of its graph.  Vertex Form for a Quadratic Equation  A quadratic equation can be written in the vertex form where the vertex of the graph is .  We can convert a quadratic equation to vertex form by completing the square.  We need the coordinates of three points to find the equation of a parabola.  We can use the method of elimination to find the equation of a parabola through three points.  If we know the vertex of a parabola, we need only one other point to find its equation.  We can use quadratic regression to fit a parabola to a collection of data points from a quadratic model.  We can use a graphical technique to solve quadratic inequalities.  To solve a quadratic inequality algebraically   Write the inequality in standard form: One side is zero, and the other has the form .  Find the -intercepts of the graph of by setting and solving for .  Make a rough sketch of the graph, using the sign of to determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward.  Decide which intervals on the -axis give the correct sign for .   We can write the solution set to a quadratic inequality in interval notation.  Interval Notation   The closed interval  is the set .  The open interval  is the set .  Intervals may also be half-open or half-closed .  The infinite interval  is the set .  The infinite interval  is the set .   To graph a quadratic equation   Determine whether the parabola opens upward (if ) or downward (if ).  Locate the vertex of the parabola.  The -coordinate of the vertex is .  Find the -coordinate of the vertex by substituting into the equation of the parabola.  Locate the -intercepts (if any) by setting and solving for .  Locate the -intercept by evaluating for .  Locate the point symmetric to the -intercept across the axis of symmetry.      Chapter 4 Review Problems   For Problems 1 4, solve by using the quadratic formula.        For Problems 5 and 6, solve the formula for the indicated variable.  for  for    For Problems 7 10, use the discriminant to determine the nature of the solutions of the equation.  one repeated real solution  two complex soutions  two complex soutions  two distinct real soutions   The height, , of an object seconds after being thrown from ground level is given by where is its starting velocity and is a constant that depends on gravity.

Summarize your work: In your own words, describe how the number of residents infected with cholera changes with time. Include a description of your graph.    Definitions and Notation  We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For example, when a physician prescribes a drug in a certain dosage, she needs to know how long the dose will remain in the bloodstream. A sales manager needs to know how the price of his product will affect its sales. A function function is a special type of relationship between variables that allows us to make such predictions.  We have already seen some examples of functions. For instance, suppose it costs $800 for flying lessons, plus $30 per hour to rent a plane. If we let represent the total cost for hours of flying lessons, then The variable is called the input variable, and is the output variable. Given a value of the input, we can calculate the corresponding output value using the formula for the function. Thus, for example       when  ,    when  ,    when  ,    We can display the relationship between two variables by a table or by ordered pairs. The input variable is the first component of the ordered pair, and the output variable is the second component. For the example above we have:                    Note that there can be only one value of for each value of . We say that \" is a function of .\"  Definition of Function  A function function is a relationship between two variables for which exactly one value of the output function output variable output variable function variable is determined by each value of the input function input variable input variable function variable.   QuickCheck 1 What distinguishes a function from other variable relationships?   There cannot be two output values for a single input value.  We can display the variables as ordered pairs.  The variables are related by a formula.  The values of the input and output variables must be different    The distance, , traveled by a car in 2 hours is a function of its speed, . If we know the speed of the car, we can determine the distance it travels by the formula .  The cost of a fill-up with unleaded gasoline is a function of the number of gallons purchased. The gas pump represents the function by displaying the corresponding values of the input variable (number of gallons) and the output variable (cost).  Score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is not a function of score on an IQ test, because two people with the same score on an IQ test may score differently on the SAT; that is, a person’s score on the SAT is not uniquely determined by his or her score on an IQ test.   Practice 1  As part of a project to improve the success rate of freshmen, the counseling department studied the grades earned by a group of students in English and algebra. Do you think that a student's grade in algebra is a function of his or her grade in English? Explain why or why not.  Phatburger features a soda bar, where you can serve your own soft drinks in any size. Do you think that the number of calories in a serving of Zap Kola is a function of the number of fluid ounces? Explain why or why not.   No, students with the same grade in English can have different grades in algebra.  Yes, the number of calories is proportional to the number of fluid ounces.   A function can be described in several different ways. In the following examples, we consider functions defined by tables, by graphs, and by equations.   Functions Defined by Tables  When we use a table to describe a function, the first variable in the table (the left column of a vertical table or the top row of a horizontal table) is the input variable, and the second variable is the output. We say that the output variable is a function of the input.   The table below shows data on sales compiled over several years by the accounting office for Eau Claire Auto Parts, a division of Major Motors. In this example, the year is the input variable, and total sales is the output. We say that total sales, , is a function of  .    Year  Total sales   2000  $612,000   2001  $663,000   2002  $692,000   2003  $749,000   2004  $904,000   The table below gives the cost of sending a letter by first-class mail in 2022.     Weight in ounces  Postage    $0.60    $0.84    $1.08    $1.32    $1.56    $1.80    $2.04   If we know the weight of the article being mailed, we can find the postage from the table. For instance, a catalog weighing 4.5 ounces would require $1.56 in postage. In this example, is the input variable and is the output variable. We say that  is a function of  .  The table below records the age and cholesterol count for 20 patients tested in a hospital survey.    Age  Cholesterol count   Age  Cholesterol count   53  217      48  232   53  241   55  198   49  186   56  238         57  208   52  264   52  248   53  195   50  214   47  203   56  271   48  212   53  193   50  234   48  172   According to these data, cholesterol count is not a function of age, because several patients who are the same age have different cholesterol levels. For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a unique value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a person’s cholesterol count.   Note that several different inputs for a function can have the same output. For example, the inputs 4.5 and 4.25 in part (b) of above have output $1.56. However, a single input cannot have more than one output, as illustrated in part (c) of the Example .  Practice 2 Decide whether each table describes as a function of . Explain your choice.                                              No, for example, corresponds both to and also to .  Yes, each value of has exactly one value of associated with it.   QuickCheck 2 How would you know if a table of values does not come from a function?   The output values are all the same.  The input values are not evely spaced.  Two different input values have the same output value.  Two different output values have the same input value    Functions Defined by Graphs  We can also use a graph to define a function. The input variable is displayed on the horizontal axis, and the output variable on the vertical axis.   The graph shows the number of hours, , that the sun is above the horizon in Peoria, Illinois, on day , where on January 1.    Which variable is the input, and which is the output?  How many hours of sunlight are there in Peoria on day 150?  On which days are there 12 hours of sunlight?  What are the maximum and minimum values of , and when do these values occur?   Peoria sunlight hours    The input variable, , appears on the horizontal axis. The number of daylight hours, , is a function of the date. The output variable appears on the vertical axis.  The point on the curve where has , so Peoria gets about 14.1 hours of daylight when , which is at the end of May.  at the two points where (in late March) and (late September).  The maximum value of 14.4 hours occurs on the longest day of the year, when , about three weeks into June. The minimum of 9.6 hours occurs on the shortest day, when , about three weeks into December.    Practice 3 The graph shows the elevation in feet, , of the Los Angeles Marathon course at a distance miles into the race. (Source: Los Angeles Times , March 3, 2005)  LA marathon elevation   Which variable is the input, and which is the output?  What is the elevation at mile 20?  At what distances is the elevation 150 feet?  What are the maximum and minimum values of , and when do these values occur?  The runners pass by the Los Angeles Coliseum at about 4.2 miles into the race. What is the elevation there?   The input variable is , and the output variable is .  Approximately 210 feet  Approximately where , , , , , and  The maximum value of 300 feet occurs at the start, when . The minimum of 85 feet occurs when .  Approximately 165 feet    Functions Defined by Equations  illustrates a function defined by an equation.   As of 2020, One World Trade Center in New York City is the nation’s tallest building, at 1776 feet. If an algebra book is dropped from the top of One World Trade Center, its height above the ground after seconds is given by the equation Thus, after second the book’s height is After seconds its height is For this function, is the input variable and is the output variable. For any value of , a unique value of can be determined from the equation for . We say that  is a function of  .   Practice 4 Write an equation that gives the volume, , of a sphere as a function of its radius, .  QuickCheck 3 Name three ways to describe a function.   By inputs, outputs, or evaluation  By tables, equations, or graphs  By the intercepts, the slope, or the vertex  By numbers, letters, or diagrams    Function Notation function notation  There is a convenient notation for discussing functions. First, we choose a letter, such as , , or (or , , or ), to name a particular function. (We can use any letter, but these are the most common choices.)  For instance, in , the height, , of a falling algebra book is a function of the elapsed time, . We might call this function . In other words, is the name of the relationship between the variables and . We write which means \" is a function of , and is the name of the function.\"  The new symbol , read \" of ,\" is another name for the height, . The parentheses in the symbol do not indicate multiplication. (It would not make sense to multiply the name of a function by a variable.) Think of the symbol as a single variable that represents the output value of the function.  With this new notation we may write or just instead of to describe the function.  Perhaps it seems complicated to introduce a new symbol for , but the notation is very useful for showing the correspondence between specific values of the variables and .   In , the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of One World Trade Center is given by the equation We see that   Using function notation, these relationships can be expressed more concisely as   which we read as \" of 1 equals 1760\" and \" of 2 equals 1712.\" The values for the input variable, , appear inside the parentheses, and the values for the output variable, , appear on the other side of the equation.  Remember that when we write , the symbol is just another name for the output variable.  For more examples of function terminology, see Section 5.1.1 of the Toolkit.  Function Notation  Function notation   QuickCheck 4 True or False.   The notation indicates the product of and .  If , then gives the value of the input variable.  If is a function of , we may write .  In the equation , the letters , , and are variables.   Practice 5 Let be the name of the function defined by the graph in , the number of hours of daylight in Peoria days after January 1.   Use function notation to state that is a function of .  What does the statement mean in the context of the problem?    The sun is above the horizon in Peoria for 9.7 hours on January 16.   QuickCheck 5 Use function notation to write the statement \" defines as a function of .\"         Using Function Notation  Finding the value of the output variable that corresponds to a particular value of the input variable is called evaluating the function evaluating the function .   Let be the name of the postage function defined by the table in b. Find , , and ).  According to the table,    when ,    so    when ,    so    when ,    so    Thus, a letter weighing 1 ounce costs $0.60 to mail, a letter weighing 3 ounces costs $1.08, and a letter weighing 6.75 ounces costs $1.04.  We can also find the input (or inputs) corresponding to a given output. For example, if is the postage function, we solve the equation by finding all input values, , that correspond to the output $0.84. According to the table in part (b), any value of greater than 1 but less than or equal to 2 is a solution.

For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a unique value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a person’s cholesterol count.

  "body": " Graphs of Functions  Reading Function Values from a Graph  The graph below shows the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (the average value of the stock prices of 500 major companies) recorded at noon each day during the stock market correction around October 10, 1987 (\"Black Monday\").  DJIA  The graph describes a function because there is only one value of the output, DJIA, for each value of the input, . There is no formula that gives the DJIA for a particular day; but it is still a function, defined by its graph. The value of is specified by the vertical coordinate of the point with the given -coordinate.   The coordinates of point on the DJIA graph are . What do the coordinates tell you about the function ?  If the DJIA was 1726 at noon on October 20, what can you say about the graph of ?    The coordinates of point tell us that , so the DJIA was 2412 at noon on October 15.  We can say that , so the point lies on the graph of . This point is labeled in the figure above.   The coordinates of each point on the graph of the function give the output for a specific input.  Graph of a Function  The point lies on the graph of the function if and only if .  Practice 1 The water level in Lake Huron alters unpredictably over time. The graph below gives the average water level, , in meters in the year over a 20-year period. (Source: The Canadian Hydrographic Service)  graph of Lake Huron water level   The coordinates of point on the graph are . What do the coordinates tell you about the function ?  The average water level in was meters. Write this fact in function notation. What can you say about the graph of ?    ; the average water level was meters in .  . The point lies on the graph of .   The second coordinate of a point on the graph is the function value for the first coordinate.  Functions and Coordinates  Each point on the graph of the function has coordinates for some value of .  QuickCheck 1 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   If lies on the graph of , then .  If , then lies on the graph of .  We can find the function value at by finding the -coordinate of the corresponding point on the graph of .  Every -coordinate on the graph of represents a function value for .   The figure shows the graph of a function .  graph of a function   Find and .  For what value(s) of is ?  What is the largest, or maximum, value of ? For what value of does the function take on its maximum value?  On what intervals is increasing?    To find , we look for the point with -coordinate . The point lies on the graph of , so . Similarly, the point lies on the graph, so .  We look for points on the graph with -coordinate . Because the points , , and lie on the graph, we know that , , and . Thus, the -values we want are , , and .  The highest point on the graph is , so the largest -value is . Thus, the maximum value of is , and it occurs when .  A graph is increasing if the -values get larger as we read from left to right. The graph of is increasing for -values between and , and between and . Thus, is increasing on the intervals and .   For more practice with function notation, see Section 5.2.1 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   A graph is called increasing if its -values increase.  The maximum function value is the -coordinate of the highest point on the graph.  If we say that is increasing on the interval , we mean that the function values increased from 2 to 7.  It is not possible for a function of to take on the same value at two different -values.   Practice 2 Refer to the graph of the function shown in .   Find .  For what value(s) of is ?  What is the smallest, or minimum, value of ? For what value of does the function take on its minimum value?  On what intervals is decreasing?      ;  and    Constructing the Graph of a Function  We can construct a graph for a function described by a table or an equation. We make these graphs the same way we graph equations in two variables: by plotting points whose coordinates satisfy the equation.  Graph the function  We choose several convenient values for and evaluate the function to find the corresponding -values. For this function we cannot choose -values less than , because the square root of a negative number is not a real number.     The results are shown in the table.                       square root graph  Points on the graph have coordinates , so the vertical coordinate of each point is given by the value of . We plot the points and connect them with a smooth curve, as shown in the figure. Notice that no points on the graph have -coordinates less than .  QuickCheck 3 How do we find the value of from a graph of ?   Using Technology to Graph a Function  We can also use a graphing utility to obtain a table and graph for the function in . We graph a function just as we graphed an equation. For this function, we enter and press ZOOM  for the standard window. Your calculator does not use the notation for graphs, so we will continue to use etc. for the output variable. Don't forget to enclose in parentheses, because it appears under a radical. The graph is shown below.  GC square root graph   Practice 3  Complete the table of values and sketch a graph of the function by hand. Then use technology to make a table of values and graph the function.                                         cubic    The Vertical Line Test  In a function, two different outputs cannot be related to the same input. This restriction means that two different ordered pairs cannot have the same first coordinate. What does it mean for the graph of the function?  Consider the graph shown in Figure (a). Every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, so there is only one point on the graph for each -value. This graph represents a function.  vertical line test  In Figure (b), however, the line intersects the graph at two points, and . Two different -values, 1 and 4, are related to the same -value, 2. This graph cannot be the graph of a function.  The Vertical Line Test function vertical line test vertical line test function  A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.  Use the vertical line test to decide which of the graphs in the figure represent functions.  vertical line test   Graph (a) represents a function, because it passes the vertical line test.  Graph (b) is not the graph of a function, because the vertical line at (for example) intersects the graph at two points.  For graph (c), notice the break in the curve at : The solid dot at is the only point on the graph with ; the open circle at indicates that is not a point on the graph. Thus, graph (c) is a function, with .   QuickCheck 4 Fill in the blanks to coplete the statements.  The vertical line test is used to decide whether a graph represents a .  If it is, there cannot be two points on the graph with the same .   Practice 4 Use the vertical line test to determine which of the graphs below represent functions.  vertical line test Only (b) is a function.   Graphical Solution of Equations and Inequalities  We have used graphs to solve linear and quadratic equations and inequalities. We can also use a graphical technique to solve equations and inequalities involving other functions.  Use a graph of to solve the equation  If we sketch in the horizontal line , we can see that there are three points on the graph of that have -coordinate , as shown below. The -coordinates of these points are the solutions of the equation.  graph of cubic  From the graph, we see that the solutions are , , and approximately . We can verify each solution algebraically.  For example, if , we have so is a solution. Similarly, you can check that and are solutions.   Practice 5 Use the graph of shown at right to solve Verify your solutions algebraically.  graph of parabola   QuickCheck 5 To solve an equation graphically, it is helpful to sketch in a line. We are looking for values that give the required value.  Use the graph in to solve the inequality    We first locate all points on the graph that have -coordinates greater than or equal to . The -coordinates of these points are the solutions of the inequality.  The figure below shows the points in red, and their -coordinates as intervals on the -axis. The solutions are and , or in interval notation, .  graph of cubic   For more practice solving equatins and inequalities with a graph, see Section 5.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6 Use the graph above from to solve the inequality   More about Notation  To simplify the notation, we sometimes use the same letter for the output variable and for the name of the function. In the next example, is used in this way.  TrailGear decides to market a line of backpacks. The cost, , of manufacturing backpacks is a function of the number of backpacks produced, , given by the equation where is in dollars. Find the cost of producing 500 backpacks.  To find the value of that corresponds to , we evaluate : The cost of producing 500 backpacks is $13,000.

  "body": " Some Basic Graphs  In this section we study the graphs of some important basic functions. Many functions fall into families or classes of similar functions, and recognizing the appropriate family for a given situation is an important part of modeling.  We'll need two new algebraic operations.  Cube Roots  You are familiar with square roots. Every non-negative number has two square roots, defined as follows. There are several other kinds of roots, one of which is called the cube root . We define the cube root as follows.  Cube Root cube root root cube root  is the cube root of if cubed equals . In symbols, we write  Square roots of negative numbers are not real (they are complex), but every real number has a real cube root. For example, Simplifying radicals occupies the same position in the order of operations as computing powers: after parentheses, and before products and quotients.  Simplify each expression.           For more examples of cube roots, see Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Simplify each expression.          QuickCheck 1 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   A negative number has a negative cube root.  A negative number has a negative square root.  A positive number has a negative square root  A positive number has a negative cube root.   We can use the calculator to find cube roots as follows. Press the MATH key to get a menu of options. Option 4 is labeled ; this is the cube root key. To find the cube root of, say, 15.625, we key in  MATH  4    ENTER and the calculator returns the result, 2.5. Thus, . You can check this result by verifying that .   Absolute Value  We use the absolute value to discuss problems involving distance. For example, consider the number line below. Starting at the origin, we travel in opposite directions to reach the two numbers and , but the distance we travel in each case is the same.  absolute value  The distance from a number to the origin is called the absolute value absolute value function absolute value absolute value of , denoted by . Because distance is never negative, the absolute value of a number is always positive (or zero). Thus, and . In general, we define the absolute value of a number as follows.  Absolute Value  The absolute value absolute value of is defined by   This definition is called piecewise , because the formula has two pieces. It says that the absolute value of a positive number (or zero) is the same as the number. To find the absolute value of a negative number, we take the opposite of the number, which is then positive. For instance,  QuickCheck 2 If , what can you say about ?   must be zero.  must be negative.  must be zero or negative.  This cannot happen for any value of .   Absolute value bars act like grouping devices in the order of operations: you should complete any operations that appear inside absolute value bars before you compute the absolute value.  Simplify each expression.       We simplify the expression inside the absolute value bars first.  We simplify each absolute value; then subtract.   For more examples using absolute value, see Section 5.3.2 and Section 5.3.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 2 Simplify each expression.         QuickCheck 3 True or False:  Hint: Try some values of and .    Eight Basic Graphs graph eight basic  Most of the graphs in this section will be new to you, but many useful graphs are variations of the eight basic functions shown below.  Consider the first pair of graphs. You have already studied the graph of , the basic parabola. Compare that graph with the graph of . Notice several differences in the shape of the two graphs. Once you have a good idea of the shape of a graph, up can make a quick sketch with just a few \"guide points.\" For these two graphs, complete a short table of values to find useful guide points:                         graphs  The next pair of graphs are and . Once again, notice the differences in the two graphs. For example, we cannot take the square root of a negative number, but we can take its cube root. How is this reflected in the graphs?   square root graph  cube root graph  The next pair of functions, and , are both undefined at , so thier graphs do not include any points with -coordinate zero. For very small positive values of , both and get very large. As gets closer to zero, the graphs approach the vertical line (the -axis). This line is called a vertical asymptote vertical asymptote asymptote vertical for the graph.  Also, notice that for very large values of , both and get very close to zero. Their graphs approach the horizontal line (the -axis). This line is called the horizontal asymptote asymptote horizontal horizontal asymptote for the graph.  graphs  Finally, compare the familiar graph of with the graph of . The piecewise definition of means that we graph in the first quadrant (where ), and in the first quadrant ). The result is the V-shaped graph shown below.   y=x  y=abs(x)  Because they are fundamental to further study of mathematics and its applications, you should become familiar with the properties of these eight graphs, and be able to sketch them easily from memory, using their basic shapes and a few guidepoints.   Problem Set 5.3  Warm Up  Evaluate each function.        For Problems 2 and 3, compute each cube root. Round your answers to three decimal places if necessary. Verify your answers by cubing them.                  For Problems 4 6, simplify each by following the order of operations.               For problems 7 10, simplify the expression according to the order of operations.                                Skills Practice  For Problems 11 16, sketch the graph of the function by hand, paying attention to the shape of the graph. Carefully plot at least three “guide points” to ensure accuracy.

  "body": " Direct Variation  Two types of functions are widely used in modeling and are known by special names: direct variation function direct variation and inverse variation function inverse variation .  Proportion and Variation direct variation variation direct variation  Two variables are directly proportional directly proportional directly proportional direct variation (or just proportional proportional directly ) if the ratios of their corresponding values are always equal. Consider the functions described in the tables below. The first table shows the price of gasoline as a function of the number of gallons purchased.    Gallons of gasoline  Total price  Price\/ Gallons                         Years  Population  People\/Years                           The ratio , or price per gallon, is the same for each pair of values in the first table. This agrees with everyday experience: The price per gallon of gasoline is the same no matter how many gallons you buy. Thus, the total price of a gasoline purchase is directly proportional to the number of gallons purchased.  The second table shows the population of a small town as a function of the town’s age. The ratio gives the average rate of growth of the population in people per year. You can see that this ratio is not constant; in fact, it increases as time goes on. Thus, the population of the town is not proportional to its age.  QuickCheck 1 When does a table represent proportional variables?   If it has a constant slope  If it includes the point  If the ratio output\/input is constant  If each output is double the previous one   The graphs of the two functions described above by tables (the gasoline price and the small town population tables) are shown below.  graphs of gas price and population growth  We see that the price, , of a fill-up is a linear function of the number of gallons, , purchased. This should not be surprising if we write an equation relating the variables and . Because the ratio of their values is constant, we can write where is a constant. In this example, the constant is , the price of gasoline per gallon. Solving for in terms of , we have which we recognize as the equation of a line through the origin.  If is proportional to , we also say that varies directly with , and we make the following definition.  Direct Variation direct variation varies directly   varies directly with if where is a positive constant called the constant of variation constant of variation direct variation constant of variation .    The circumference, , of a circle varies directly with its radius, , because The constant of variation is , or about 6.28.  The amount of interest, , earned in one year on an account paying 7% simple interest, varies directly with the principal, , invested, because   In the opening example, we saw that the price of gasoline, , is a linear function of the number of gallons purchased. From the definition above, we see that any direct variation defines a linear function of the form Compareing this equation to the standard form for a linear function, , we see that the constant term, , is zero, so the graph of a direct variation passes through the origin. The positive constant in the equation is just the slope of the graph, so it tells us how rapidly the graph increases. direct variation  Practice 1 graphs of three lines  Which of the graphs above could represent direct variation? Explain why.   (a). The graph is a straight line that increases.  (b). The graph is a straight line through the origin.  (c). The graph is a straight line that decreases.  None of the above  (b): The graph is a straight line through the origin.  QuickCheck 2  A table describes direct variation if the ratio of corresponding entries is .  A graph describes direct variation if it is a .  An equation describes direct variation if it has the form .  If two variables vary directly, we may also say that they are .     The Scaling Property of Direct Variation  Because the graph of passes through the origin, direct variation has the following scaling property: if we double the value of , then the value of will double also. In fact, increasing by any factor causes to increase by the same factor. Look again at the table for the price of buying gasoline. Doubling the number of gallons of gas purchased, say, from gallons to gallons or from gallons to gallons, causes the total price to double also.  QuickCheck 3 You invest $800 for one year at 7% simple interest. The interest earned is  If you increase the investment by a factor of, say, 1.6, to 1.6(800) or $1280, the interest will be  The original interest is increased by a factor of .  $56; $89.60; 1.6    Tuition at Woodrow University is $400 plus $30 per unit. Is the tuition proportional to the number of units you take?  Imogen makes a 15% commission on her sales of environmentally friendly products marketed by her co-op. Do her earnings vary directly with her sales?    Let represent the number of units you take, and let represent your tuition. Then Thus, is a linear function of , but the -intercept is , not . Your tuition is not proportional to the number of units you take, so this is not an example of direct variation. You can check that doubling the number of units does not double the tuition. For example, and Tuition for units is not double the tuition for units. The graph of in figure (a) does not pass through the origin.  calculator graphs of two linear functions  Let represent Imogen’s sales, and let represent her commission. Then Thus, is a linear function of with a -intercept of zero, so Imogen's earnings do vary directly with her sales.   Practice 2 Which table could represent direct variation? Explain why. (Hint: What happens to if you multiply by a constant?)                                       (a): If we multiply by a constant, is also multiplied by the same constant.   Finding a Formula for Direct Variation direct variation finding a formula for  If we know any one pair of values for the variables in a direct variation, we can find the constant of variation. Then we can use the constant to write a formula for one of the variables as a function of the other.  If you kick a rock off the rim of the Grand Canyon, its speed, , varies directly with the time, , it has been falling. The rock is falling at a speed of 39.2 meters per second when it passes a lizard on a ledge 4 seconds later.  Express as a function of .  What is the speed of the rock after it has fallen for 6 seconds?  Sketch a graph of versus .    Because varies directly with , there is a positive constant for which . We substitute and and solve for to find Replacing by , we find the formula .  We evaluate the function found in part (a) for . At seconds, the rock is falling at a speed of 58.8 meters per second.

The surface area of a sphere varies directly with the square of its radius. A balloon of radius 5 centimeters has surface area square centimeters, or about 314 square centimeters.

Sketch a graph of the function.    If stands for the surface area of a sphere of radius , then To find the constant of variation, , we substitute the values of and . Thus, .  We solve the variation equation for when . The radius is centimeters, or about 7.1 centimeters.  The graph has the shape of the basic function , so all we need are a few points to \"anchor\" the graph. We know that , and or about . A graph is shown below.  (Need graph here)   For more examples of direct variation, see Section 5.4.1 , Section 5.4.2 , and Section 5.4.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4 The volume of a sphere varies directly with the cube of its radius. A balloon of radius 5 centimeters has volume cubic centimeters, or about 524 cubic centimeters.  Find a formula for the volume, , of a sphere as a function of its radius, .  What is the radius of a balloon whose volume is cubic centimeters, or about 1028 cubic centimeters?  Sketch a graph of the function.    We solve the variation equation for when . The radius is centimeters, or about 6.3 centimeters.  (Need graph here)   In any example of direct variation, as the input variable increases through positive values, the output variable increases also. Thus, a direct variation is an increasing function, increasing function increasing function increasing graph as we can see when we consider the graphs of some typical direct variations shown below.  graphs of three variation with power  The graph of a direct variation always passes through the origin, so when the input is zero, the output is also zero. Thus, the functions and , for example, are not direct variation, even though they are increasing functions for positive .  QuickCheck 5 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   Every increasing function is a direct variation.  Every direct variation is an increasing function.  The graph of every direct variation is a straight line.  The graph of every direct variation passes through the origin.   Even without an equation, we can check whether a table of data describes direct variation or merely an increasing function. If varies directly with , then , or, equivalently,  Test for Direct Variation direct variation test for test for direct variation  If the ratio is constant, then varies directly with .  Delbert collects the following data and would like to know if varies directly with the square of . What should he calculate?                  If varies directly with , then , or . Delbert should calculate the ratio for each data point.                         Because the ratio is not constant, does not vary directly with .    Scaling scaling property of direct variation direct variation scaling property  If varies directly with , then doubling causes to double also. But what if varies directly with a power of :  Is the area of a -inch circular pizza double the area of an -inch pizza?  If you double the dimensions of a model of a skyscraper, will its weight double also?   You probably know that the answer to both of these questions is No . The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius, and the volume (and hence the weight) of an object is proportional to the cube of its linear dimension. Variation with a power of produces a different scaling effect.  The Taipei 101 building is 1671 feet tall, and in 2006 it was the tallest skyscraper in the world. Show that doubling the dimensions of a model of the Taipei 101 building produces a model that weighs 8 times as much.  The Taipei 101 skyscraper is approximately box shaped, so its volume is given by the product of its linear dimensions, . The weight of an object is proportional to its volume, so the weight, , of the model is where the constant depends on the material of the model. If we double the length, width, and height of the model, then The weight of the new model is times the weight of the original model.  Practice 6 Use the formula for the area of a circle to show that doubling the diameter of a pizza quadruples its area.  Step 1: The formula for the area of a circle of radius is  Step 2: If we double the diameter, the new radius is  Step 3: Substitute the new expression for the radius into the area formula to get the area of the new circle.   The new radius is .  The new area is  In general, if varies directly with a power of , that is, if , then doubling the value of causes to increase by a factor of . In fact, if we multiply by any positive number , then so the value of is multiplied by .  We will call the scaling exponent scaling exponent direct variation scaling exponent exponent scaling , and you will often see variation described in terms of scaling. For example, we might say that \"the area of a circle scales as the square of its radius.\" (In many applications, the power is called the scale factor , even though it is not a factor but an exponent.)

  "body": " Functions as Models  The Shape of the Graph  To create a good model we first decide what kind of function to use. What sort of function has the right shape to describe the process we want to model? Should it be increasing or decreasing, or some combination of both? Is the slope constant or is it changing?  In Examples and , we investigate how the shape of a graph illustrates the nature of the process it models.   Forrest leaves his house to go to school. For each of the following situations, sketch a possible graph of Forrest's distance from home as a function of time.  Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop.  Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop; then he waits there until the bus arrives.  Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop, waits there until the bus arrives, and then the bus drives him to school at a constant speed.    The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in figure (a). It begins at the origin because at the instant Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when .) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrest’s walking speed.  distance from home  The first part of the graph is the same as part (a). But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in figure (b). The line has slope because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is .  The graph begins like the graph in part (b). The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in figure (c).   Practice 1 Erin walks from her home to a convenience store, where she buys some cat food, and then walks back home. Sketch a possible graph of her distance from home as a function of time.  piecewise graph   The graphs in are portions of straight lines. We can also consider graphs that bend upward or downward. The bend is called the concavity concavity concavity concave up, concave down graph concavity of the graph.  The two functions described in this example are both increasing functions, but they increase in different ways. Match each function to its graph and to the appropriate table of values.   The number of flu cases reported at an urban medical center during an epidemic is an increasing function of time, and it is growing at a faster and faster rate.  The temperature of a potato placed in a hot oven increases rapidly at first, then more slowly as it approaches the temperature of the oven.                                   increasing graphs of opposite concavity    The number of flu cases is described by graph (A) and table (1). The function values in table (1) increase at an increasing rate. We can see this by computing the rate of change over successive time intervals. The increasing rates can be seen inthe figure below; the graph bends upward as the slopes increase.  cocave up graph  The temperature of the potato is described by graph (B) and table (2).

In this section we'll look at a few of the other basic functions.  Choose one of the eight basic functions to model each situation, and sketch a possible graph.   The number of board-feet, , that can be cut from a Ponderosa pine is a function of the cube of the circumference, , of the tree at a standard height.  The manager of an appliance store must decide how many coffee-makers to order every quarter. The optimal order size, , is a function of the square root of the annual demand for coffee-makers, .  The loudness, or intensity, , of the music at a concert is a function of the reciprocal of the square of your distance, , from the speakers.    cubic   square root   inverse square   For more about the basic functions, see Section 5.6.1 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2 Which basic graph is concave down wherever it is defined?        Practice 3 Choose one of the eight basic functions to model each situation, and sketch a possible graph.   The contractor for a new hotel is estimating the cost of the marble tile for a circular lobby. The cost, , is a function of the square of the diameter, , of the lobby.  Investors are deciding whether to support a windmill farm. The wind speed, , needed to generate a given amount of power is a function of the cube root of the power, .  The frequency, , of the note produced by a violin string is a function of the reciprocal of the length, , of the string.   ,  graph  ,  graph  ,  graph   The next Example illustrates an application of the function .  The speed of sound is a function of the temperature of the air in kelvins. (The temperature, , in kelvins is given by , where is the temperature in degrees Celsius.) The table shows the speed of sound, , in meters per second, at various temperatures, .                     Plot the data to obtain a graph. Which of the basic functions does your graph most resemble?  Find a value of so that fits the data.  On a summer night when the temperature is Celsius, you see a flash of lightning, and 6 seconds later you hear the thunderclap. Use your function to estimate your distance from the thunderstorm.    The graph of the data is shown below. The shape of the graph reminds us of the square root function, .  speed of sound  We are looking for a value of so that the function fits the data. We substitute one of the data points into the formula and solve for . If we choose the point , we obtain and solving for yields . We can check that the formula is a good fit for the rest of the data points as well. Thus, we suggest the function as a model for the speed of sound.  First, we use the model to calculate the speed of sound at a temperature of Celsius. The Kelvin temperature is so we evaluate for . Thus, is approximately 343.4 meters per second.  The lightning and the thunderclap occur simultaneously, and the speed of light is so fast (about 30,000,000 meters per second) that we see the lightning flash as it occurs. So if the sound of the thunderclap takes seconds after the flash to reach us, we can use our calculated speed of sound to find our distance from the storm. The thunderstorm is 2060 meters, or about 1.3 miles, away.   Practice 4 The ultraviolet index (UVI) is issued by the National Weather Service as a forecast of the amount of ultraviolet radiation expected to reach Earth around noon on a given day. The data show how much exposure to the sun people can take before risking sunburn.

Which of the basic functions do your graphs most resemble?  For each graph, find a value of so that fits the data.   two concave up decreasing curves  The graphs resemble .  More sensitive: , Less sensitive:    QuickCheck 3 To decide which basic function might model a set of data, we can   plot the data.  look at the variables.  choose scales for the axes.  calculate the slope.   At this point, a word of caution is in order. There is more to choosing a model than finding a curve that fits the data. A model based purely on the data is called an empirical model empirical model model empirical . However, many functions have similar shapes over small intervals of their input variables, and there may be several candidates that model the data. Such a model simply describes the general shape of the data set; the parameters parameter of the model do not necessarily correspond to any actual process.  In contrast, mechanistic models mechanistic models model mechanistic provide insight into the biological, chemical, or physical process that is thought to govern the phenomenon under study. Parameters derived from mechanistic models are quantitative estimates of real system properties. Here is what GraphPad Software has to say about modeling:  \"Choosing a model is a scientific decision. You should base your choice on your understanding of chemistry or physiology (or genetics, etc.). The choice should not be based solely on the shape of the graph.  \"Some programs . . . automatically fit data to hundreds or thousands of equations and then present you with the equation(s) that fit the data best. Using such a program is appealing because it frees you from the need to choose an equation. The problem is that the program has no understanding of the scientific context of your experiment. The equations that fit the data best are unlikely to correspond to scientifically meaningful models. You will not be able to interpret the best-fit values of the variables, and the results are unlikely to be useful for data analysis.\"  (Source: Fitting Models to Biological Data Using Linear and Nonlinear Regression , Motulsky & Christopoulos, GraphPad Software, 2003)   The Absolute Value and Distance distance (absolute value)  The absolute value function is used to model problems involving distance. Recall that the absolute value of a number gives the distance from the origin to that number on the number line.  QuickCheck 4 To find the absolute value of a number, we can   change its sign.  subtract it from 0.  find its distance from 0.  square it.

Thus, the solutions of the inequality are as shown in figure (a).  On the other hand, to solve the inequality , we look for points on the graph with -values greater than . In figure (b), we see that these points have -values outside the interval between and . In other words, the solutions of the inequality are or .

The price of gasoline has fallen steadily over the past few months.   four curves    Each situation in Problems 21 26 can be modeled by a transformation of a basic function.

Match each description with the appropriate table of values and with its graph.  As a chemical pollutant pours into a lake, its concentration is a function of time. The concentration of the pollutant initially increases quite rapidly, but due to the natural mixing and self-cleansing action of the lake, the concentration levels off and stabilizes at some saturation level.  An overnight express train travels at a constant speed across the Great Plains. The train's distance from its point of origin is a function of time.  The population of a small suburb of a Florida city is a function of time. The population began increasing rather slowly, but it has continued to grow at a faster and faster rate.  The level of production at a manufacturing plant is a function of capital outlay, that is, the amount of money invested in the plant. At first, small increases in capital outlay result in large increases in production, but eventually the investors begin to experience diminishing returns on their money, so that although production continues to increase, it is at a disappointingly slow rate.                                                                                                      four increasing graphs   Table (4), Graph (C)  Table (3), Graph (B)  Table (1), Graph (D)  Table (2), Graph (A)   Four different functions are described below.

Fresh water flowing through Crystal Lake has gradually reduced the phosphate concentration to its natural level, and it is now stable.  The number of bacteria in a person during the course of an illness is a function of time. It increases rapidly at first, then decreases slowly as the patient recovers.  A squirrel drops a pine cone from the top of a California redwood. The height of the pine cone is a function of time, decreasing ever more rapidly as gravity accelerates its descent.

As the global population increases, many scientists believe it is approaching, or has already exceeded, the maximum number the Earth can sustain. This maximum number, or carrying capacity, carrying capacity depends on the finite natural resources of the planet -- water, land, air, and materials -- but also on how people use and preserve the resources. The graphs show four different ways that a growing population can approach its carrying capacity over time. (Source: Meadows, Randers, and Meadows, 2004)  models of world population limits  Match each graph to one of the scenarios described in (a)-(d), and explain your choice.  Sigmoid growth: the population levels off smoothly below the carrying capacity.  Overshoot and collapse: the population exceeds the carrying capacity with severe damage to the resource base, and is forced to decline rapidly to achieve a new balance with a reduced carrying capacity.  Continued growth: the carrying capacity is far away, or growing faster than the population.  Overshoot and oscillation: the population exceeds the carrying capacity without inflicting permanent damage, then oscillates around the limit before leveling off.

The graph of the data is shown below. The shape of the graph reminds us of the square root function, .  speed of sound  We are looking for a value of so that the function fits the data. We substitute one of the data points into the formula and solve for . If we choose the point , we obtain and solving for yields . We can check that the formula is a good fit for the rest of the data points as well. Thus, we suggest the function as a model for the speed of sound.  First, we use the model to calculate the speed of sound at a temperature of Celsius. The Kelvin temperature is so we evaluate for . Thus, is approximately 343.4 meters per second.  The lightning and the thunderclap occur simultaneously, and the speed of light is so fast (about 30,000,000 meters per second) that we see the lightning flash as it occurs. So if the sound of the thunderclap takes seconds after the flash to reach us, we can use our calculated speed of sound to find our distance from the storm. The thunderstorm is 2060 meters, or about 1.3 miles, away.  "

Sigmoid growth: the population levels off smoothly below the carrying capacity.

Continued growth: the carrying capacity is far away, or growing faster than the population.  Overshoot and oscillation: the population exceeds the carrying capacity without inflicting permanent damage, then oscillates around the limit before leveling off. "

Function Notation  Function Notation  Finding the value of the output variable that corresponds to a particular value of the input variable is called evaluating the function .  The point lies on the graph of the function if and only if .  Each point on the graph of the function has coordinates for some value of .  The Vertical Line Test  A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.   We can use a graphical technique to solve equations and inequalities.  is the cube root of if cubed equals . In symbols, we write  Absolute Value  The absolute value of is defined by  Absolute value bars act like grouping devices in the order of operations: you should complete any operations that appear inside absolute value bars before you compute the absolute value.  The maximum or minimum of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex.  Eight basic functions and their graphs are important in applications:  Two variables are directly proportional if the ratios of their corresponding values are always equal.  Direct Variation   varies directly with if where is a positive constant called the constant of variation .  Direct variation defines a linear function of the form The positive constant in the equation is just the slope of the graph.  Direct variation has the following scaling property: increasing by any factor causes to increase by the same factor.  Direct Variation with a Power   varies directly with a power of if where and are positive constants.  If the ratio is constant, then varies directly with .  Inverse Variation   varies inversely with if where is a positive constant.  Inverse Variation with a Power   varies inversely with if where and are positive constants.  If the product is constant and is positive, then varies inversely with .  A graph that bends upward is called concave up , and one that bends downward is concave down .

  "body": "Integer Exponents exponent integer power function  You know that that a positive integer exponent tells us how many times its base occurs as a factor in an expression. For example,  What is the meaning of a negative exponent?  Negative Exponents  Study the list of powers of 2 shown in Table (a) and observe the pattern as we move up the list from bottom to top. Each time the exponent increases by 1 we multiply by another factor of 2. We can continue up the list as far as we like.   a.  If we move back down the list, we divide by 2 at each step, until we get to the bottom of the list, . What if we continue the list in the same way, dividing by 2 each time we decrease the exponent? The results are shown in Table (b).  As we continue to divide by 2, we generate fractions whose denominators are powers of 2. In particular,  table of integer exponents  b.   Based on these observations, we make the following definitions.  Definition of Negative and Zero Exponents exponent negative exponent zero negative and zero exponents negative exponents     These definitions tell us that if the base is not zero, then any number raised to the zero power is , and that a negative exponent denotes a reciprocal.       A negative exponent does not mean that the power is negative! For example,  In b, note that The exponent, , applies only to the base , not to .  exponent negative  QuickCheck 1 True or false.   Negative exponents are used to denote reciprocals.  We can write as .  Any number raised to the zero power is zero.    Practice 1 Write each expression without using negative exponents.          For more practice using negative exponents, see Section 6.1.1 of the Toolkit.  In the next Example, we see how to evaluate expressions that contain negative exponents and how to solve equations involving negative exponents.  The body mass index, or BMI, is one measure of a person’s physical fitness. Your body mass index is defined by where is your weight in kilograms and is your height in meters. The World Health Organization classifies a person as obese if his or her BMI is 25 or higher.  Calculate the BMI for a woman who is 1.625 meters (64 inches) tall and weighs 54 kilograms (120 pounds).  For a fixed weight, how does BMI vary with height?  The world’s heaviest athlete is the amateur sumo wrestler Emanuel Yarbrough, who weighs 319 kg (704 pounds). What height would Yarbrough have to be to have a BMI under 25?    We evaluate the formula to find  , so BMI varies inversely with the square of height. That is, for a fixed weight, BMI decreases as height increases.  To find the height that gives a BMI of , we solve the equation . Note that the variable appears in the denominator of a fraction, so we begin by clearing the denominator—in this case we multiply both sides of the equation by . To have a BMI under 25, Yarbrough would have to be over 3.75 meters, or 11 feet 8 inches tall. (In fact, he is 6 feet 8 inches tall.)   Practice 2 Solve the equation  Hint:      Power Functions  The functions that describe direct and inverse variation are part of a larger family of functions called power functions .  Power Function power function  A function of the form where and are nonzero constants, is called a power function power function .  Examples of power functions are In addition, the basic functions which we studied in can be written as Their graphs are shown below. Note that power functions with negative exponents are undefined at zero.  graphs of the two basic reciprocal functions  Which of the following are power functions?        This is not a power function, because of the addition of the constant term.  We can write , so is a power function.  This is not a power function, but it can be treated as the sum of two power functions, because .   QuickCheck 2 True or false.  The exponent in a power function must be positive.  Direct and inverse variation are examples of power functions.  If is a power function, then .  The sum of two power functions is not always a power function.   Practice 3 Write each function as a power function in the form .           Most applications are concerned with positive variables only, so many models use only the portion of the graph in the first quadrant.  The intensity of the radiation from our Sun varies inversely with distance.   Use a negative exponent to write a formula for the intensity as a function of .  The planet Mercury is 0.387 AU (Astronomical Units astronomical units ) distant from the Sun, and the intensity of radiation at its surface is 9147 watts per square meter. Find the constant of proportionality in the formula for .  Graph .  Earth is 1 AU from the Sun. What is the intensity of the Sun's radiation at the surface of the Earth?  The surface of Jupiter receives 50.63 watts per square meter of the Sun's radiation. How far is Jupiter from the Sun?   If we use for the constant of proportionality, then . Rewriting this equation with a negative exponent gives .  We substitute and to obtain Thus, .  We evaluate the function for several values of , and use technology to obtain the graph shown.  triangle  We substitute into the formula to obtain Earth receives 1370 watts\/m of solar radiation.  We substitute into the formula, and solve for . Jupiter is 5.202 AU from the Sun, or about 484 million miles.   The function is an example of an inverse square law inverse square law , because varies inversely with the square of . Such laws are fairly common in physics and its applications, because gravitational and other forces behave in this way. Here is another example of an inverse square law.  Practice 4 Cell phone towers typically transmit signals at 10 watts of power. The signal strength varies inversely with the square of distance from the tower, and 1 kilometer away the signal strength is 0.8 picowatt. (A picowatt is watt.) Cell phones can receive a signal as small as 0.01 picowatt. How far can you be from the nearest tower and still hope to have cell phone reception? About 9 km   Working with Negative Exponents exponent negative  The laws of exponents apply to all integer exponents, positive negative, and zero. When we allow negative exponents, we only need one version of the rule for computing quotients of powers, namely For example, by applying this new version of the law we find which is consistent with our previous version of the rule,  For reference, we restate the laws of exponents below. The laws are valid for all integer exponents and , and for .  Laws of Exponents  laws of exponents exponent laws of              You can check that each of the calculations in is shorter when we use negative exponents instead of converting the expressions into algebraic fractions.  Practice 5 Simplify by applying the laws of exponents. Write without negative exponents.         To review using the laws of exponents, see Section 6.1.2 of the Toolkit.  The laws of exponents do not apply to sums or differences of powers. We can add or subtract like terms, that is, powers with the same exponent. For example, but we cannot combine terms with different exponents into a single term. Thus, for example,   In the opening table we saw that , and in fact as long as . Now we can see that this definition is consistent with the laws of exponents. The quotient of any (nonzero) number divided by itself is . But by applying the second law of exponents, we also have  Zero as Exponent zero exponent exponent zero    For example,   Review of Scientific Notation scientific notation  Scientists and engineers regularly encounter very large numbers such as, (the mass of the earth in kilograms) and very small numbers such as (the mass of a hydrogen atom in grams) in their work. These numbers are easier to use when expressed in scientific notation .  To Write a Number in Scientific Notation scientific notation   Locate the decimal point so that there is exactly one nonzero digit to its left.  Count the number of places you moved the decimal point: this determines the power of 10.  If the original number is greater than 10, the exponent is positive.  If the original number is less than 1, the exponent is negative.  Write each number in scientific notation.          For more help practicec with scientific notation, see Section 6.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6 Write each number in scientific notation.         Your calculator displays numbers in scientific notation if they are too large or too small to fit in the display screen. Try squaring the number on your calculator. Enter and the calculator will display the result as This is how the calculator displays the number . Notice that the power is displayed as E 16.  To enter a number in scientific form, we use the key labeled EE , possibly accessed by pressing 2nd  , . For example, to enter we enter the keying sequence  EE  (-)   In 2019, the average American ate 98.6 kilograms of meat. It takes about 16 kilograms of grain to produce one kilogram of meat, and advanced farming techniques can produce about 6000 kilograms of grain on each hectare of arable land. (A hectare is 10,000 square meters, or just under two and a half acres.)  Now, the total land area of the Earth is about 13 billion hectares, but only about 11% of that land is arable. Is it possible for each of the 7.8 billion people on Earth to eat as much meat as Americans do?  First we'll compute the amount of meat necessary to feed every person on earth 110 kilograms per year. In scientific notation, the population of Earth is people. Next we'll compute the amount of grain needed to produce that much meat. Next we'll see how many hectares of land are needed to produce that much grain. Finally, we'll compute the amount of land on Earth suitable for grain production. The amount of arable land on Earth is less than the amount needed to produce that much grain. Thus, even if we use every hectare of arable land to produce grain for livestock, we won't have enough to provide every person on Earth with 98.6 kilograms of meat per year.

Write a formula for the rate of flow as a power function of radius.  If the radius and length of the artery are measured in centimeters, then the constant of variation, , is determined by blood pressure and viscosity. If a certain artery is 20 centimeters long, what should its radius be in order to allow a blood flow of 5 liters per minute?

  "body": "The body mass index, or BMI, is one measure of a person’s physical fitness. Your body mass index is defined by where is your weight in kilograms and is your height in meters. The World Health Organization classifies a person as obese if his or her BMI is 25 or higher.  Calculate the BMI for a woman who is 1.625 meters (64 inches) tall and weighs 54 kilograms (120 pounds).  For a fixed weight, how does BMI vary with height?  The world’s heaviest athlete is the amateur sumo wrestler Emanuel Yarbrough, who weighs 319 kg (704 pounds). What height would Yarbrough have to be to have a BMI under 25?    We evaluate the formula to find  , so BMI varies inversely with the square of height. That is, for a fixed weight, BMI decreases as height increases.  To find the height that gives a BMI of , we solve the equation . Note that the variable appears in the denominator of a fraction, so we begin by clearing the denominator—in this case we multiply both sides of the equation by . To have a BMI under 25, Yarbrough would have to be over 3.75 meters, or 11 feet 8 inches tall. (In fact, he is 6 feet 8 inches tall.)  "

It takes about 16 kilograms of grain to produce one kilogram of meat, and advanced farming techniques can produce about 6000 kilograms of grain on each hectare of arable land. (A hectare is 10,000 square meters, or just under two and a half acres.)  Now, the total land area of the Earth is about 13 billion hectares, but only about 11% of that land is arable. Is it possible for each of the 7.8 billion people on Earth to eat as much meat as Americans do?  First we'll compute the amount of meat necessary to feed every person on earth 110 kilograms per year. In scientific notation, the population of Earth is people. Next we'll compute the amount of grain needed to produce that much meat. Next we'll see how many hectares of land are needed to produce that much grain. Finally, we'll compute the amount of land on Earth suitable for grain production. The amount of arable land on Earth is less than the amount needed to produce that much grain. Thus, even if we use every hectare of arable land to produce grain for livestock, we won't have enough to provide every person on Earth with 98.6 kilograms of meat per year.  "

We'll see that fractional exponents can denote square roots and other radicals.  Roots n root root n  Recall that is a square root of if , and is a cube root of if . For example, is a square root of because , and is a cube root of because .  In a similar way, we can define the fourth, fifth, or sixth root of a number. For instance, the fourth root of is the number because .  th Roots  is called an  th root of if .  We use the symbol to denote the th root of . An expression of the form is called a radical radical , is called the radicand radicand , and is called the index of the radical index (of a radical) .    because  because  because  because  because   To review the definition of root, see Section 6.2.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Evaluate each radical.           Exponential Notation for Radicals exponential notation for radicals exponent rational exponent fractional radical exponential notation  A convenient notation for radicals uses fractional exponents. Consider the expression . What meaning can we attach to an exponent that is a fraction? Recall that when we raise a power to a power, we multiply the exponents together: Therefore, if we square the number , we get Thus, is a number whose square is . But this means that is a square root of , or  QuickCheck 1 Fill in the blanks.   Inverse variation can be expressed as a power function by using a exponent.  The number in the expression is called the of the radical.  We use exponents to denote radicals.  State the law of exponents that shows that is a square root of .   Remember that actually has two square roots, namely and . But the symbol represents only the positive square root, so that . The same is true for the exponent : any nonnegative number raised to the power is equal to the positive square root of the number, or     is not a real number.    Practice 2 Evaluate each power.              The same reasoning works for roots with any index index (of a radical) . For instance, is the cube root of , because Thus, we make the following definition for fractional exponents.  Exponential Notation for Radicals exponent rational exponent fractional radical exponential notation index (of a radical)  For any integer and for ,        Note that An exponent of denotes the square root of its base, and an exponent of denotes the cube root of its base.  Practice 3 Write each power with radical notation, and then evaluate.         Of course, we can use decimal fractions for exponents as well. For example,      Practice 4 Write each power with radical notation, and then evaluate.         QuickCheck 2 True or false.   The exponent tells us to take a reciprocal.  The exponent 0.2 denotes a fifth root.  A power with a negative exponent is not a real number.  The expressions and are the same.    Irrational Numbers  What about th roots such as and that cannot be evaluated easily? These are examples of irrational numbers irrational numbers . An irrational number is one that cannot be expressed as a quotient of two integers.  It is not possible to write down an exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number, but we can find an approximation to as many decimal places as we like. We can use a calculator to obtain decimal approximations for irrational numbers. For example, you can verify that  The following keying sequence for evaluating the irrational number is incorrect:  7 1 5 ENTER  You can check that this sequence calculates , instead of . Recall that according to the order of operations, powers are computed before multiplications or divisions. We must enclose the exponent in parentheses and enter  7 ( 1 5 ) ENTER   Or, because , we can enter  7 0.2 ENTER  To review irrational numbers, see Section 6.2.2 of the Toolkit.   Working with Fractional Exponents exponent rational exponent fractional  Fractional exponents simplify many calculations involving radicals. It will be useful for you to convert easily between exponential and radical notation.  Convert each radical to exponential notation.     In part (b) of the Example above, the parentheses around must not be omitted. The expression means .  Remember that a negative exponent denotes a reciprocal.  Practice 5 Convert each radical to exponential notation.          Convert each power to radical notation.       In , note that the exponent applies only to , not to .

QuickCheck 3 True or false.   All expressions of the form represent irrational numbers.  When we enter an exponent into a calculator, we must enclose it in parentheses.  In the expression , the exponent does not apply to 16.  You can use your calculator to find a decimal equivalent for an irrational number.    Using Fractional Exponents to Solve Equations exponent rational exponent fractional  We know that raising to powers and taking roots are inverse operations, that is, each operation undoes the effects of the other. This relationship is especially easy to see when the root is denoted by a fractional exponent. For example, to solve the equation we would take the fifth root of each side. But instead of using radical notation, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power : Notice again that , so Thus, to solve an equation involving a power function , we first isolate the power, then raise both sides to the exponent .  For astronomers, the mass of a star is its most important property, but it is also the most difficult to measure directly. For many stars, their luminosity, or brightness, varies roughly as the fourth power of the mass.  Our Sun has luminosity watts and mass kilograms. Because the numbers involved are so large, astronomers often use these solar constants as units of measure: The luminosity of the Sun is solar luminosity, and its mass is solar mass. Write a power function for the luminosity, , of a star in terms of its mass, , using units of solar mass and solar luminosity.  The star Sirius is 23 times brighter than the Sun, so its luminosity is 23 solar luminosities. Estimate the mass of Sirius in units of solar mass.    Because varies as the fourth power of , we have Substituting the values of and for the Sun (namely, and ), we find so and .  We substitute the luminosity of Sirius, , to get To solve the equation for , we raise both sides to the power. The mass of Sirius is about 2.2 solar masses, or about 2.2 times the mass of the Sun.

The radical may be denoted by a fractional exponent. For example, the equation is a radical equation because . To solve the equation, we first isolate the power to get Then we raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal of , or .  When a car brakes suddenly, its speed can be estimated from the length of the skid marks it leaves on the pavement. A formula for the car’s speed, in miles per hour, is where the length of the skid marks, , is given in feet.  If a car leaves skid marks 80 feet long, how fast was the car traveling when the driver applied the brakes?  How far will a car skid if its driver applies the brakes while traveling 80 miles per hour?    To find the velocity of the car, we evaluate the function for . The car was traveling at approximately 44 miles per hour.  We would like to find the value of when the value of is known. We substitute into the formula and solve the equation Because appears to the power , we first square both sides of the equation to get You can check that this value for works in the original equation. Thus, the car will skid approximately 267 feet. A graph of the function is shown below, along with the points corresponding to the values in parts (a) and (b).  velocity vs braking distance   Thus, we can solve an equation where one side is an th root of by raising both sides of the equation to the th power. We must be careful when raising both sides of an equation to an even power, since extraneous solutions may be introduced. However, because most applications of power functions deal with positive numbers only, they do not usually involve extraneous solutions. extraneous solution  QuickCheck 5  How do we solve the equation ?

Similarly, is not a real number, because there is no real number for which . (Both of these radicals represent complex numbers complex number .) In general, we cannot find an even root (square root, fourth root, and so on) of a negative number.  On the other hand, every positive number has two even roots that are real numbers. For example, both and are square roots of . The symbol refers only to the positive, or principal root principal root root principal root positive root principal root principal root root , of . If we want to refer to the negative square root of , we must write . Similarly, both and are fourth roots of , because and . However, the symbol refers to the principal, or positive, fourth root only. Thus,  Things are simpler for odd roots (cube roots, fifth roots, and so on). Every real number, whether positive, negative, or zero, has exactly one real-valued odd root. For example,  Here is a summary of our discussion.  Roots of Real Numbers root of real numbers   Every positive number has two real-valued roots, one positive and one negative, if the index is even.  A negative number has no real-valued root if the index is even.  Every real number, positive, negative, or zero, has exactly one real-valued root if the index is odd.    is not a real number.    is not a real number.

The metabolic rate is the amount of energy the animal uses per unit of time for its usual activities, including locomotion, growth, and reproduction.  The basal metabolic rate, or BMR, sometimes called the resting metabolic rate, is the minimum amount of energy the animal can expend in order to survive.  In the next example we study Kleiber's Rule, which uses a fractional exponent in decimal form.  To review converting between common fractions and decimals, see Section 6.3.2 of the Toolkit.  A revised form of Kleiber's Rule Kleiber's Rule states that the basal metabolic rate for many groups of animals is given by where is the mass of the animal in kilograms and the BMR is measured in kilocalories per day.  Calculate the BMR for various animals whose masses are given in the table.    Animal  Bat  Squirrel  Raccoon  Lynx  Human  Moose  Rhinoceros   Weight (kg)          BMR (kcal\/day)          Sketch a graph of Kleiber’s rule for .  Do larger species eat more or less, relative to their body mass, than smaller ones?    We evaluate the function for the values of given. For example, to calculate the BMR of a bat, we compute A bat expends, and hence must consume, at least 12 kilocalories per day. We evaluate the function to complete the rest of the table. The values of BMR are rounded to the nearest whole number.    Animal  Bat  Squirrel  Raccoon  Lynx  Human  Moose  Rhinoceros   Weight (kg)          BMR (kcal\/day)          We plot the data from the table to obtain the graph below.  BMR vs mass  If energy consumption were proportional to body weight, the graph would be a straight line. But this graph is concave down, or bends downward. Larger species eat less than smaller ones, relative to their body weight. For example, a moose weighs 600 times as much as a squirrel, but its energy requirement is only 121 times the squirrel's.   QuickCheck 2 True or false   The graph of is concave down.  Energy consumption is not directly proportional to body weight.  An animal twice as heavy as a squirrel uses twice as much energy as a squirrel.  The graph of passes through the origin.

Operations with Rational Exponents  Powers with rational exponents—positive, negative, or zero—obey the laws of exponents, which we discussed in . You may want to review those laws before studying the following examples.  Use the laws of ecponents to simplify each expression.        To review operations on fractions, see Section 6.3.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 5 Simplify by applying the laws of exponents.          Solving Equations  According to the third law of exponents, when we raise a power to another power, we multiply the exponents together. In particular, if the two exponents are reciprocals, then their product is . For example, This observation can help us to solve equations involving fractional exponents. For instance, to solve the equation we raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal power, . This gives us The solution is .  Solve  We raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal power, .  For more practice solving equartionss, see Section 6.3.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6 Solve the equation . Round your answer to two decimal places.  Hint:    QuickCheck 3 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   The first step in solving an equation with a fractional exponent is to isolate the power.  Then we raise both sides to the reciprocal of the exponent.  We can use the laws of exponents to simplify expressions involving fractional exponents.  The reciprocal of 0.6 is .     Inflating a Balloon  If you blow air into a balloon, what do you think will happen to the air pressure inside the balloon as it expands? Here is what two physics books have to say:  “The greater the pressure inside, the greater the balloon’s volume.” Jay Boleman, Physics, a Window on Our World  “Contrary to the process of blowing up a toy balloon, the pressure required to force air into a bubble decreases with bubble size.” Francis Sears, Mechanics, Heat, and Sound   On the basis of these two quotations and your own intuition, sketch a graph of pressure as a function of the diameter of the balloon. Describe your graph: Is it increasing or decreasing? Is it concave up (bending upward) or concave down (bending downward)?  Two high school students, April Leonardo and Tolu Noah, decided to see for themselves how the pressure inside a balloon changes as the balloon expands. Using a column of water to measure pressure, they collected the following data while blowing up a balloon. Graph their data on the grid below.     Diameter (cm)  Pressure (cm O)                                                         grid  Describe the graph of April and Tolu’s data. Does the graph confirm the predictions of the physics books?  As the diameter of the balloon increases from 5 cm to 20 cm, the pressure inside decreases. Can we find a function that describes this portion of the graph? Here is some information:  Pressure is the force per unit area exerted by the balloon on the air inside, or .  The balloon is spherical, so its surface area, , is given by surface area of a sphere .  Because the force increases as the balloon expands, we will try a power function of the form , where and are constants, to see if it fits the data.

According to the equation, what level of power can be maintained for 3 hours?  The Gossamer Albatross needed 250 watts of power to keep it airborne. For how long can 250 watts be maintained, according to the equation?  Birds’ eggs typically lose 10%–20% of their mass during incubation. The embryo metabolizes lipid during growth, and this process releases water vapor through the porous shell. The incubation time for birds’ eggs is a function of the mass of the egg and has been experimentally determined as where is measured in grams and in days. (Source: Burton, 1998)  Calculate the incubation time (to the nearest day) for the wren, whose eggs weigh about 2.5 grams, and the greylag goose, whose eggs weigh 46 grams.  The rate of water loss from the egg is also a function of its mass and appears to follow the rule Combine the functions and to calculate the fraction of the initial egg mass that is lost during the entire incubation period.  Explain why your result shows that most eggs lose about 18% of their mass during incubation.   15 days, 28 days   is close to 1  The incubation time for birds’ eggs is given by where is measured in grams and in days.

(Source: Burton, 1998)  Combine the functions and to calculate the total amount of oxygen taken in by the egg during its incubation.  Use your result from part (a) to explain why total oxygen consumption per unit mass is approximately inversely proportional to incubation time. (Oxygen consumption is a reliable indicator of metabolic rate, and it is reasonable that incubation time should be inversely proportional to metabolic rate.)  Predict the oxygen consumption per gram of a herring gull’s eggs, given that their incubation time is 26 days. (The actual value is 11 milliliters per day.)

  "body": "Working with Radicals  Sometimes radical notation is more convenient to use than exponents. In these cases, we usually simplify radical expressions algebraically before using a calculator to obtain decimal approximations.  Properties of Radicals  Because , we can use the laws of exponents to derive two important properties that are useful in working with radicals.  Product Rule for Radicals product rule for radicals    Quotient Rule for Radicals quotient rule for radicals radical quotient rule for    As examples, you can verify that  In general, it is not true that is equivalent to , or that is equivalent to .  For example, you can check that  Which of the following are true?   Is  Is  Is  Is   The statements in (b) and (d) are true, and both are examples of the first property of radicals .  Statements (a) and (c) are false.  For more on the properties of radicals, see Section 6.4.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 1 Which of the following are true?   ?  ?  , for ?  ?    Simplifying Radicals radical simpifying  Each time we use a calculator to approximate a radical, we lose accuracy, and in the course of a long calculation, the error accumulates. To avoid this problem, we simplify radicals by factoring out any perfect powers from the radicand.  Simplify  We look for perfect cubes that divide evenly into . The easiest way to do this is to try the perfect cubes in order: and so on, until we find one that is a factor. For this example, we find that . Applying the Product Rule, we write This expression is considered simpler than the original radical because the new radicand, , is smaller than the original, .  For more on factoring out perfect powers, see Section 6.4.1 of the Toolkit.  Finding a decimal approximation for a radical is not the same as simplifying the radical. In the Example above, we can use a calculator to find but is not the exact value for .  In long calculations, too much error may be introduced by approximating each radical. However, is equal to , so their values are exactly the same. We can replace one expression by the other without losing accuracy.  Practice 1 Simplify  We can also simplify radicals containing variables. If the exponent on the variable is a multiple of the index, we can extract the variable from the radical. For instance, (You can verify this by noting that .)  Do not confuse with . Compare the two radicals:  Simplify   Because the exponent on the variable, 11, is not a multiple of the index, 3, we factor out the highest power that is a multiple.  Practice 2 Simplify  To simplify a root of a monomial, we factor the coefficient and each power of a variable separately.  Simplify each radical.       The index of the radical is , so we look for perfect square factors of . The factor is a perfect square, and has an exponent divisible by . Thus,  The index of the radical is , so we look for perfect cube factors of . The factor is a perfect cube, and and have exponents divisible by . Thus,   For more help on simplifying radicals, see Section 6.4.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3 Simplify  Hint: Look for perfect cube factors of .  Apply the product Rule.  Take cube roots.   It is worth stating again that the Product Rule applies only to products under the radical, not to sums or differences. For example, and   QuickCheck 2 True or false.   To simplify a radical means to find a decimal approximation.   We cannot simplify      Sums and Differences of Radicals radical sums and differences of  How can we add or subtract radicals? Keep in mind that, in general, We cannot add or subtract expressions that occur under a radical. For example, you can check that However, if two roots have the same index and identical radicands, they are said to be like radicals like radical radical like radicals . We can add or subtract like radicals in the same way that we add or subtract like terms, namely by adding or subtracting their coefficients. For example, we know that where is a variable that can stand for any real number. In particular, if , we have So we may add like radicals by adding their coefficients. The same idea applies to subtraction.  Like Radicals  To add or subtract like radicals, we add or subtract their coefficients. We do not change the index or the radicand.       In a, . Only the coefficients are added; the radicand does not change.  Sums of radicals with different radicands or different indices cannot be combined. Thus, None of the expressions above can be simplified.   Practice 4 Simplify  QuickCheck 3 True or false.   We combine like radicals the same way we combine like terms: by adding or subtracting their coefficients.  To add radicals with different indices, we multiply the indices.   Like radicals must have identical coefficients.   Sometimes we must simplify the roots in a sum or difference before we can recognize like radicals.  Simplify  We simplify each cube root by factoring perfect cubes from the radicals.   Practice 5 Simplify    Products and Quotients of Radicals  Because of the Product and Quotient Rules, we can multiply or divide radicals of the same index. These rules tell us that for products and quotients, the radicands do not have to be the same; only the indices must match.  Simplify.      We apply the Product Rule to write the product as a single radical, then simplify.  We apply the Quotient Rule to write the quotient as a single radical, then reduce the fraction under the radical.   Practice 6 Simplify.         For products involving binomials, we apply the distributive law.  Expand each product.     We multiply each term within the parentheses by .  We use the \"FOIL\" method to expand the product.   In part (a) of the Example above, observe that We multiply together any expressions outside the radical, and apply the product rule to expressions under the radical.  Practice 7 Expand   QuickCheck 4 True or false.   We can only simplify products or quotients of like radicals.       Rationalizing the Denominator radical rationalizing the denominator rationalizing the denominator rationalizing the denominator radical  It is easier to work with radicals if there are no roots in the denominators of fractions. We can use the fundamental principle of fractions to remove radicals from the denominator. This process is called rationalizing the denominator rationalizing the denominator . For square roots, we multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the radical in the denominator.  Rationalize the denominator of each fraction.      First, we apply the Quotient Rule to write the radical as a quotient.   It is always best to simplify the denominator before rationalizing. Now we can see that we should multiply numerator and denominator by — not !   Practice 8 Rationalize the denominator of  If the denominator of a fraction is a binomial binomial denominator with radical in which one or both terms is a radical, we can use a special building factor to rationalize it. First, recall that In particular, then, The product contains no radicals. Each of the two factors and is said to be the conjugate conjugate of the other.  Now consider a fraction of the form If we multiply the numerator and denominator of this fraction by the conjugate of the denominator, we get The denominator of the fraction no longer contains any radicals—it has been rationalized.  Rationalize the denominator: .   We multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, .  For more examples of rationalizing the denominator, see Section 6.4.4 of the Toolkit.  Practice 9 Rationalize the denominator of  QuickCheck 5 Fill in the blanks.   We rationalize the denominator to remove from the denominator.  To rationalize a binomial denominator, we multiply by its .  Before rationalizing, it is always best to .        Problem Set 6.4  Warm Up  Each question in Problems 1 4 is followed by three examples.

We solve simple radical equations by raising both sides to the appropriate power. For example, to solve the equation we square both sides to find You can check that is the solution for this equation.  Solve  We first divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate the radical. Next, we cube both sides of the equation.   The solution is 36. We can also solve the equation graphically by graphing , as shown in the figure. The point lies on the graph, so is the solution of the equation   transformed cube root function    For more examples of solving radical equations, see Section 6.5.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Solve  Hint:  Isolate the radical.  Raise each side to the fourth power.  Complete the solution.    Extraneous Solutions  Whenever we raise both sides of an equation to an even power, it is possible to introduce false or extraneous solutions extraneous solution . For example, the equation has no solution, because is never a negative number. However, if we try to solve the equation by squaring both sides, we find You can check that is not a solution to the original equation, , because does not equal .  Raising both sides of an equation to an odd power does not introduce extraneous solutions. However, if we raise both sides to an even power, we should check each solution in the original equation.  QuickCheck 1 When we raise both sides of an equation to an power, it is possible to introduce solutions.  Solve the equation  First, we isolate the radical expression on one side of the equation. (This will make it easier to square both sides.)  Check  Does ?    Does ?    The apparent solution is extraneous. The only solution to the original equation is . We can verify the solution by graphing the equations   as shown at right. The graphs intersect in only one point, , so there is only one solution, .  graphs of both sides of radical equation  When we square both sides of an equation, it is not correct to square each term of the equation separately. Thus, in , the original equation is not equivalent to This is because . Instead, we must square the entire left side of the equation as a binomial, like this, or we may proceed as shown in .  Practice 2  Solve  Hint:  Square both sides.  Solve the quadratic equation.  Check for extraneous roots.   QuickCheck 2 True or false.   At most one of the solutions of a radical equation can be extraneous.  We don't have to check for extraneous solutions if we cube both sides of an equation.  We can square each term of an equation separately without changing its solutions.  It is helpful to isolate the radical before squaring both sides.    Solving Formulas  We can also solve formulas involving radicals for one variable in terms of the others.  Solve the formula for .  Because the variable we want is under a square root, we square both sides of the equation, to get   Practice 3 Solve the formula for .   Equations with More than One Radical equation with more than one radical  Sometimes we need to square both sides of an equation more than once in order to eliminate all the radicals.  Solve .   First, we isolate the more complicated radical on one side of the equation. (This will make it easier to square both sides.) We subtract from both sides to get Now we square each side to remove one radical. Be careful when squaring the binomial .  We collect like terms, and isolate the radical on one side of the equation. Finally, we square both sides again to obtain  Check Does ?    For more help on squaring binomials, see Section 6.5.2 of the Toolkit.  Recall that we cannot solve a radical equation by squaring each term separately. So it is incorrect to begin by writing We must square the entire expression on each side of the equal sign as one piece.  Practice 4  Solve  Hint:  Square both sides.  Isolate the radical term.  Divide both sides by 4.  Square both sides again.  Solve the quadratic equation.  Check for extraneous roots.  ;   Simplifying  We have seen that raising to a power is the inverse operation for extracting roots, so that For example, What if the power and root operations occur in the opposite order? Is it always true that ?  First, consider the case where the index is an odd number. For example, Because every real number has exactly one th root if is odd, we see that, However, if is even, then is positive, regardless of whether itself is positive or negative, and hence is positive also. For example, if , then In this case, does not equal , because is negative but is positive. We must be careful when taking even roots of powers. We have the following special relationship for even roots.  We summarize our results in the box below.  Roots of Powers root of powers   In particular, note that it is not always true that , unless we know that . Otherwise, we can only assume that .  To review absolute value, see Section 6.5.3 of the Toolkit.     Practice 5 Simplify.          QuickCheck 3 True or false.   If an equation contains more than one radical, we square each term of the equation.    If , then .  If is even and , then is always positive.     Problem Set 6.5  Warm Up  Solve the equation.

Definition of Negative and Zero Exponents   A negative exponent denotes a reciprocal, as long as the base is not zero. A negative exponent does not mean that the power is negative.  Power Function  A function of the form where and are nonzero constants, is called a power function power function .  Laws of Exponents       The laws of exponents are used to simplify products and quotients of powers, not for sums or differences of powers. We can combine (add or subtract) like terms, but we cannot combine terms with different exponents into a single term.  To Write a Number in Scientific Notation  Locate the decimal point so that there is exactly one nonzero digit to its left.  Count the number of places you moved the decimal point: this determines the power of 10.  If the original number is greater than 10, the exponent is positive.  If the original number is less than 1, the exponent is negative.   th Roots  is called an  th root of if .  Exponential Notation for Radicals  For any integer and for ,   It is not possible to write down an exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number, but we can find an approximation to as many decimal places as we like.  To solve an equation involving , we first isolate the power, then raise both sides to the exponent .  We can solve an equation where one side is an th root of by raising both sides of the equation to the th power. We must be careful when raising both sides of an equation to an even power, as extraneous solutions may be introduced.  Roots of Real Numbers  Every positive number has two real-valued roots, one positive and one negative, if the index is even.  A negative number has no real-valued root if the index is even.  Every real number, positive, negative, or zero, has exactly one real-valued root if the index is odd.   A fractional exponent represents a power and a root. The denominator of the exponent is the root, and the numerator of the exponent is the power. We will define fractional powers only when the base is a positive number.  Direct variation has the following scaling property: increasing by any factor causes to increase by the same factor.  Rational Exponents   Rational Exponents and Radicals   To solve an equation with a fractional exponent we first isolate the power. Then we raise both sides to the reciprocal of the exponent.  Product Rule for Radicals     Quotient Rule for Radicals   In general, it is not true that is equivalent to , or that is equivalent to .  We simplify radicals by factoring out any perfect powers from the radicand.  We can add or subtract like radicals in the same way that we add or subtract like terms, by adding or subtracting their coefficients.  We can use the fundamental principle of fractions to remove radicals from the denominator. This process is called rationalizing the denominator.  Whenever we raise both sides of an equation to an even power, it is possible to introduce false or extraneous solutions.  Roots of Powers      Chapter 6 Review Problems  For Problems 1 6, write without negative exponents and simplify.

Express your answer in standard notation, both in terms of hours and in terms of years. 1,200,000,000,000 hr, or 78,904,109,590 yr  In the twenty-first century, spacecraft may be able to travel at speeds of meters per second, 1000 times their current speed. (At that speed you could circumnavigate the Earth in 1.3 seconds.)  How long would it take to reach the Sun at this speed? The Sun is approximately meters from Earth.  What fraction of the speed of light ( meters per second) is this speed?  How long would it take to reach Proxima Centauri, 4.2 light years from Earth? A light year is the distance that light can travel in one year.  5000 sec, or 83 min   42 yr   Use the data in the table to calculate the density of each of the planets as follows: first find the volume of the planet, assuming planets are spherical.

Shipbuilders find that the average cost of producing a ship decreases as more of those ships are produced. This relationship is called the experience curve, and is given by the equation where is the average cost per ship in millions of dollars and is the number of ships produced.

  "body": "Exponential Growth and Decay  Introduction  While completing the next Investigation, keep in mind that using an exponent, or raising to a power, means repeated multiplication by the base.  Population Growth  In a laboratory experiment, researchers establish a colony of bacteria and monitor its growth. The colony triples in population every day.                                             Fill in the table showing the population of bacteria days later.  Plot the data points from the table and connect them with a smooth curve.  Write a function that gives the population of the colony at any time , in days. Hint: Express the values you calculated in part (1) using powers of . What connection do you see between the value of and the exponent on ?  Graph your function from part (3) using technology. (Use the table to choose an appropriate window.) The graph should resemble your hand-drawn graph from part (2).  Evaluate your function to find the number of bacteria present after 8 days. How many bacteria are present after 36 hours (1.5 days)?   grid for graph of bacteria population    The function in describes exponential growth . During each time interval of a fixed length, the population is multiplied by a certain constant amount. In this case, the bacteria population grows by a factor of 3 every day.  table of bacteria population  For this reason, we say that 3 is the growth factor growth factor exponential growth growth factor for the function.   Growth Factors  Researchers often use cell lines from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study protein interactions related to cancer and other diseases. From 60% to 70% of human disease genes are found in Drosophila cells, and gene discoveries in the flies have led to parallel studies in vertebrates.  One milliliter of culture contains about 1 million Drosophila cells, and the population doubles every 24 hours. The table shows the population, , of Drosophila cells, in millions, as a function of time in days.     (days)  (millions)                        Growth of Drosophila melanogaster  Looking at the table, we see that we multiply the fruit fly population by 2 every day, so that after days, the initial population is multiplied by . Because the population grows by a factor of 2 each day, the function describes exponential growth. We can express functions that describe exponential growth in a standard form.  Exponential Growth exponential growth exponential growth growth factor growth factor exponential growth initial value exponential growth initial value  The function describes exponential growth , where is the initial value of the function and the positive constant is the growth factor .  For the Drosophila cell population, the growth factor is , and the initial value is million cells, so we have There is a sort of similarity between the formula for exponential functions and the formula for linear functions. Each has an initial value and a constant that describes change. But compare the graph of exponential growth, described by a constant growth factor, with linear growth. You can see that the graph of the fruit fly population is not a straight line with a constant slope, as a linear function would be.  In 1985, there were about 1.2 million cell phone users world-wide. For some years after that time, the number grew by a factor of 1.5 each year.  Let be the number of cell phone users years after 1985 according to this model. Make a table of values and graph .  Write a formula for  How many cell phone users does this model predict for the year 2000?  Do you think this model will be valid indefinitely? Why or why not?    We let in 1985, so , in millions. Each value of can be obtained by multiplying the previous value by the growth factor, 1.5.                                  growth of cellphone owners  The initial value of the function is million. The annual growth factor is , so the formula is  The year 2000 is 15 years after 1985, so we evaluate the function for . The formula predicts that over 525 million people used cell phones in 2000.  It is unlikely that the model will be valid indefinitely, because will eventually exceed the population of Earth.   Once again, in the examples above, you can see that the graphs of these exponential functions are not linear. In each case, the function grows slowly at first, but eventually grows faster and faster.  Be careful when evaluating exponential growth functions. In part (c) of the previous Example, note that According to the order of operations, we compute the power first, and then multiply the result by 1.2.   To review the order of operations with powers, see Section 7.1.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 1 A population grows according to the formula , where is in years.   What was the starting value of the population?  What was the population one year later?  What does 1.06 tell you about the population?  Choose the correct first step to evaluate :  Multiply 800 by 1.06 or  Raise 1.06 to the 5th power    In the next Practice, we consider a population that doubles not every month, but every three months.  Practice 1 A colony of rabbits started with 20 rabbits and doubles every 3 months.    Complete the table for the number of rabbits after months, and graph the function.  How is the exponent on the base 2 related to ? Write a formula for the function .  How many rabbits will there be after 1 year?                                                           rabbit population  The exponent is the value of divided by 3.  320 rabbits  In Practice 1, the rabbit population doubled every 3 months, leading to the growth law Notice how the 3 of \"every 3 months\" appears in the formula.  Now suppose we would like to know the monthly growth factor for the rabbit population, that is, by what factor did the population grow every month?  Recall that when we raise a power to a power we can multiply the exponents, like this: For example, Using the same idea for the rabbit population, we can see that So the growth factor for the rabbit population is , or about 1.26. The rabbit population grows by a factor of 1.26 every month.   Comparing Linear Growth and Exponential Growth exponential function vs linear growth exponential growth vs linear growth  It may be helpful to compare linear growth linear growth and exponential growth exponential growth. Consider the two functions whose graphs are shown below.                      Slope                     Growth factor  graph of linear and exponential  is a linear function with -intercept 5 and slope 2; is an exponential function with initial value 5 and growth factor 2. In a way, the growth factor of an exponential function is analogous to the slope of a linear function: Each measures how quickly the function is increasing.  However, for each unit increase in , 2 units are added to the value of , whereas the value of is multiplied by 2. An exponential function with growth factor 2 eventually grows much more rapidly than a linear function with slope 2, as you can see by comparing the graphs or the function values in the tables.   A solar energy company sold $80,000 worth of solar collectors last year, its first year of operation. This year its sales rose to $88,000. The marketing department must estimate its projected sales for the next 3 years.   If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow linearly, what sales total should it expect next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next 3 years, assuming that sales will grow linearly.  If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow exponentially, what sales total should it expect next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next 3 years, assuming that sales will grow exponentially.    Let represent the company's total sales years after starting business, where is the first year of operation. If sales grow linearly, then has the form . Because , the intercept is 80,000. The slope of the graph is where is the increase in sales during the first year. Thus, , and sales grow by adding $8000 each year. The expected sales total for the next year is  Let represent the company's sales assuming that sales will grow exponentially. Then has the form , and the initial value is . We find the growth factor in sales over the first year by dividing by : Thus, , and the expected sales total for the next year is   We evaluate each function at several points to obtain the graphs shown in the figure.                             linear and exponential growth    Exponential Decay  In the examples above, exponential growth was modeled by increasing functions increasing function of the form where the growth factor, , is a number greater than 1. If we multiply the function value by a number smaller than 1, t he function values will decrease. Thus, if , then is a decreasing function. decreasing function In this case, we say that the function describes exponential decay exponential decay , and the constant is called the decay factor decay factor exponential decay decay factor .  Observe that if , then powers of decrease as the exponent increases. For example, consider powers of .               Exponential Decay exponential decay  A small coal-mining town has been losing population since 1940, when 5000 people lived there. At each census thereafter (taken at 10-year intervals), the population declined to approximately 0.90 of its earlier figure.                                         Fill in the table showing the population of the town years after 1940.  Plot the data points and connect them with a smooth curve.  Write a function that gives the population of the town at any time in years after 1940.  Hint: Express the values you calculated in part (1) using powers of 0.90. What is the connection between the value of and the exponent on 0.90?  Graph your function from part (3) using technology. (Use the table to choose an appropriate window.) The graph should resemble your hand-drawn graph from part (2).  Evaluate your function to find the population of the town in 1995.

During the second half of the last century, the percent of beer volume sold in refillable glass bottles declined to 0.942 of its previous value each year.   In 1944, 98% of beer was sold in refillable bottles. Write a formula for the percent of beer sold in refillable bottles as a function of , the number of years after 1944.  Graph the function from 1944 to 2000.  In 1998, only 3.3% of beer was sold in refillable bottles. How well does the model predict this number?    We let in 1944, so that .

Let represent the perch population years after 2000. Complete the table.                    Write a formula for the function .

We can tell whether a linear function is increasing or decreasing by whether its slope is .  We can tell whether an exponential function is increasing or decreasing by whether is .  If a linear function has slope 1.5, each time we increase the input by 1 unit, how do we find the new function value from the old one?  If an exponential function has growth factor 1.5, each time we increase the input by 1 unit, how do we find the new function value from the old one?    Percent Increase percent increase  Exponential growth is often described as growth by a certain percent increase. Suppose the town of Lakeview had 4000 residents in the year 2000, and grew at a rate of 5% per year. This means that each year we add 5% of last year's population to find the current population, . Thus and so on. Now here is the important observation about percent increase:    Thus, we can find the current population by multiplying the old population by 1.05. In other words,   A formula for the population of Lakeview years after 2000 is This formula describes exponential growth with a growth factor of . In general, a function that grows at a percent rate , where is expressed as a decimal, has a growth factor of .  Growth by a Constant Percent growth by a constant percent  The function describes exponential growth at a constant percent rate of growth, .  The initial value initial value of the function is , and is the growth factor exponential growth growth factor .  Many quantities besides population can grow by a fixed percent. For example, an inflation rate gives the percent rate at which prices are rising.  During a period of rapid inflation, prices rose by 12% each year. At the beginning of this time, a loaf of bread cost $2.  Make a table showing the cost of bread over the next four years.  Write a function that gives the price of a loaf of bread years after inflation began.  How much did a loaf of bread cost after 6 years? After 30 months?   Graph the function found in (b).    The percent increase in the cost of bread is 12% every year. Therefore, the growth factor for the cost of bread is every year. If represents the price of bread after years, then , and we multiply the price by 1.12 every year, as shown in the table.                                      After years of inflation the original price of $2 has been multiplied times by a factor of 1.12. Thus,  To find the price of bread at any time after inflation began, we evaluate the function at the appropriate value of . After 6 years the price was $3.95. Thirty months is 2.5 years, so we evaluate . After 30 months the price was $2.66.   To graph the function we evaluate it for several values, as shown in the table. We plot the points and connect them with a smooth curve to obtain the graph shown.  percent increase   For some hints on evaluating expponential expressions, see Section 7.1.3 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 3 Fill in the blanks.  Increasing by 10% is the same as multiplying by .  If a population grows by 2% annually, its growth factor is .  If a population grows by 46% annually, its growth factor is .  If a population grows by 100% annually, its growth factor is .    Practice 3 Tombstone, Arizona was the most famous \"boomtown\" during the gold rush in the American west. It was established in December, 1879, after the discovery of a large silver deposit nearby. The original town had 40 dwellings and a population of 100. Over the next two to three years, the population grew at an average rate of 19% per month.  What was the population one year later, in December, 1880?  Write a formula for , the population of Tombstone months after its founding.  Complete the table and sketch a graph of .                    Tombstone's peak population was about 10,000 people. Use your graph to estimate the time it took to reach that figure.   806              100  239  569  1359  3243  7739  population Tombstone, AZ  About 26 months   Compound interest is another example of exponential growth. Suppose you deposit a sum of money into an account that pays 5% interest compounded annually. Each year, 5% of your current balance is added to your account as interest, so your balance grows by a factor of 1.05. In general, we have the following formula.  Compound Interest compound interest balance compound interest compound interest balance compound interest principal  If a principal principal of dollars is invested in an account that pays an interest rate compounded annually, the balance balance  after years is given by   Percent Decrease percent decrease  We have seen that a percent increase of (in decimal form) corresponds to a growth factor of . A percent decrease of corresponds to a decay factor decay factor of . For example, if a population declines by 25% each year, then each year the new population is 75% of its previous value. So and . Remember that multiplying by gives us the population remaining, not the amount of decline.  To review percent increase and decrease, see Section 7.1.1 of the Toolkit.  According to Context magazine: \"Computing prices have been falling exponentially for the past 30 years and will probably stay on that curve for another couple of decades.\" In fact, prices have been falling at a rate of 37% every year. Suppose an accounting firm invests $50,000 this year in new computer equipment.   Write a formula for the cost of similar equipment years from now.  What would the same equipment cost 5 years from now?  Graph the function for .   The current cost of the equipment is . Every year, the cost of similar equipment is multiplied by After years, the cost of that equipment is  After 5 years, we have The cost of the equipment after 5 years is $4962.18.   We evaluate the function for several values of , and plot the points to obtain the graph shown.                  computing prices    In the preceding Example, the cost of computer equipment decreases by 37% each year, so 63% of the value remains, and the decay factor for the value function is 0.63, not 0.37. The function gives the cost remaining, not the amount that has declined.  Practice 4 The number of butterflies visiting a nature station is declining by 18% per year. In 1998, 3600 butterflies visited the nature station.   What is the decay factor in the annual butterfly count?  Write a formula for , the number of butterflies years after 1998.

Each year, the population decreases to 25% of its previous value.  In the first description, and . If the population this year is 100, next year it will be 75. If 25% of the population is gone, 75% remains.  In the second description, only 25% of the population remains, so . If the population this year is 100, next year it will be 25.

Practice 5 A new car begins to depreciate in value as soon as you drive it off the lot. Some models depreciate linearly, and others depreciate exponentially. Suppose you buy a new car for $20,000, and 1 year later its value has decreased to $17,000.   If the value decreased linearly, what was its annual rate of decrease?  If the value decreased exponentially, what was its annual decay factor? What was its annual percent depreciation?

Dyar’s rule says that the size of the insect increases by a constant ratio at each stage. (Source: Burton, 1998.)  Dyar measured the width of the head of a caterpillar of a swallowtail butterfly at each stage. The caterpillar’s head was initially approximately 42 millimeters wide and was 63.84 millimeters wide after its first stage. Find the growth ratio.  Write an equation for the width of the caterpillar’s head at the stage.  Graph your equation on your calculator.  What head width does the model predict after 5 stages?

  "body": "Exponential Functions  Introduction  In , we studied functions that describe exponential growth or decay. A population of rabbits grew according to the formula , and a butterfly count decreased by . These functions are examples of the family of exponential functions. Here are some more examples. We define an exponential function as follows.  Exponential Function exponential function function exponential  An exponential function has the form   The positive constant is called the base base of an exponential function exponential function base of of the exponential function. The constant gives the -intercept, , of the graph because For the examples above, we find that the -intercepts are  QuickCheck 1 Which of the following is an exponential function?         We do not allow to be negative, because if , then is not a real number for some values of . For example, if and , then is an imaginary number.  We also exclude as a base because for all values of ; hence the function is actually the constant function .  The constant can be negative, but for our work we'll consider only positive values of .   During the summer a population of fleas doubles in number every 5 days.  If a population starts with 10 fleas, write a formula for the number of fleas present after days.  How many fleas will there be after 1 week (7 days)?    We let represent the number of fleas present after days. The original population of 10 fleas doubles not every day, but every 5 days. A table of values for would look like this.                            Notice that the original population is multiplied by another factor of 2 every 5 days. We must divide by 5 to see how many times the population doubles. The formula for is thus  We evaluate the function for . To follow the order of operations, we simplify the power before multiplying by 10.  After one week there will be 26 fleas.   For more practice evaluating exponential functions, see Section 7.2.1 of the Toolkit.  In the Example above, we can also write the formula as (See Note 7.1.5 for another example of this calculation.) From this form see that the growth factor for this function is , or about 1.149. The flea population grows at about 14.9% per day.  Practice 1 During an advertising campaign in a large city, the makers of Chip-O's corn chips estimate that the number of people who have heard of Chip-O's increases by a factor of 8 every 4 days.   If 100 people are given trial bags of Chip-O's to start the campaign, write a function, , for the number of people who have heard of Chip-O's after days of advertising.  How many people have heard of Chip-O's after 10 days of advertising?    Approximately 18,100 people     Graphs of Exponential Functions  The graphs of exponential functions have two characteristic shapes, depending on whether the base, , is greater than or less than . As typical examples, consider the graphs of and shown below. Some values for and are recorded in the tables.                              exponential growth                               exponential decay   Notice that is an increasing function and is a decreasing function decreasing function . Both are concave up. In general, exponential functions have the following properties.  Properties of Exponential Functions, , properties of exponential functions exponential function concave up  If , the function is increasing increasing function and concave up;  if , the function is decreasing decreasing function and concave up.  The -intercept y -intercept is . There is no -intercept.   In the table for , you can see that as the -values decrease toward negative infinity, the corresponding -values decrease toward zero. As a result, the graph of decreases toward the -axis, but never touches it, as we move to the left.  The negative -axis is a horizontal asymptote asymptote horizontal horizontal asymptote for exponential functions with , as shown in figure (a).  For exponential functions with , the positive -axis is an asymptote, as illustrated in figure (b).  QuickCheck 2 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   An exponential function is not defined for negative inputs.  The outputs of an exponential function cannot be negative.  The -intercept of the function is .  The function decreases by 8 each time we increase by 1.   How does the value of affect the graph? For increasing functions, the larger the value of the base, , the faster the function grows. In the Example below, we compare two exponential functions with different bases.  Compare the graphs of and .  First, we evaluate each function for several convenient values, as shown in the table.  Then we plot the points for each function and connect them with smooth curves. Note that for both functions, so their graphs have the same -intercept, .  For positive -values, is always larger than , and is increasing more rapidly. In the figure, we can see that climbs more rapidly than . However, for negative -values, is smaller than .                             two exponential growth functions    Practice 2  Which of the graphs above is , and which is ?  Which graph decreases more steeply?    two exponential decay functions   Graph I is , and graph II is .  decreases more steeply   Perhaps you see a similarity in the formula for exponential functions, , and the formula for linear functions, . In an exponential function the base tells us how fast the function increases or decreases, much as the slope does for linear functions, and the constant tells us the intial value when , as does the constant in the linear formula .  QuickCheck 3 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   An exponential function is always positive.  For , the function has a horizontal asymptote at .  The value of determines how rapidly the graph of increases or decreases.  The graph of is decreasing if .    Comparing Exponential and Power Functions exponential function vs power functions power function vs exponential function  We have studied several families of functions, including linear, quadratic, and power functions. Exponential functions are useful because they model growth or decline by a constant factor.  Exponential functions exponential function are not the same as the power functions power function we studied earlier. Although both involve expressions with exponents, it is the location of the variable that makes the difference.   A power function, , has a variable base and a constant exponent.  An exponential function, , has a constant base and a variable exponent.   Power Functions vs Exponential Functions exponential function vs power functions power function vs exponential functions        Power Functions  Exponential Functions   General formula     Description  variable base and constant exponent  constant base and variable exponent   Example     These two families of functions have very different properties, as well.  Which of the functions shown below is exponential, and which is a cubic power function? Find an equation for each.                                                        cubic and exponential functions  We can tell that is the exponential function because its values increase by a factor of 3 for each unit increase in . The base of the function is . We also see from the table that , so . Thus, must be the power function, . To find , we notice that , so , and .  As you can see from the figure, the graphs of the two functions in the previous Example are also quite different. In particular, note that the power function passes through the origin, while the exponential function approaches the negative -axis as a horizontal asymptote.  From the table, we see that , so the two graphs intersect at . (They also intersect at approximately .) However, if you compare the values of and for larger values of , you will see that eventually the exponential function overtakes the power function.  The relationship in holds true for all increasing power and exponential functions: For large enough values of , the exponential function will always be greater than the power function, regardless of the parameters in the functions. exponential growth vs power function increasing function The figure at left shows the graphs of and . At first, , but at around , overtakes , and for all .  power function vs exponential from 0 to 50  Practice 3 Which of the following functions are exponential functions, and which are power functions?        Exponential: (a) and (c); power: (b) and (d)   QuickCheck 4 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   A power function eventually grows more rapidly than an exponential function.  To find the base of an exponential function, we can divide any function value of an integer by the previous one.  Power functions and exponential functions both pass through the origin.  Exponential functions model growth or decline by a constant factor.    Exponential Equations  An exponential equation exponential equation is one in which the variable is part of an exponent. For example, the equation is exponential.  Many exponential equations can be solved by writing both sides of the equation as powers with the same base. To solve the equation above, we write which is true if and only if . exponential equation solving  In general, if two equivalent powers have the same base, then their exponents must be equal also, as long as the base is not or .  In the next Example, we use the laws of exponents to express both sides of the equation as single powers of a common base.  Solve the following equations.       Using the fact that , we write each side of the equation as a power of : Now we equate the exponents to obtain The solution is .  We write each factor as a power of . We use the laws of exponents to simplify each side: Now we equate the exponents to obtain The solution is .   For more examples of exponential equations, see Section 7.2.2 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 5 Which is a good strategy for solving ?   Divide both sides by 3.  Add to both sides.  Simplify the left side.  Write the right side as a power of 3.   Practice 4 Solve the equation .   Exponential equations arise frequently in the study of exponential growth.  In Example 1 we wrote a formula for a population of fleas that started with 10 fleas and doubles in number every 5 days. How long will it be before there are 10,240 fleas?  We set and solve for : We equate the exponents to get , or . The population will grow to 10,240 fleas in 50 days.   QuickCheck 6 Complete the statement or answer the question.  If two equivalent powers have the same nonzero base, or , then their must be equal also.  An exponential equation is one in which the variable is part of .  simplifies to 3 raised to what power?  If a population doubles every 3 days, its growth factor is 2 raised to what power?    Graphical Solution of Exponential Equations exponential equation graphical solution of  It is not always so easy to express both sides of the equation as powers of the same base. In the following sections, we will develop more general methods for finding exact solutions to exponential equations.

Much the same way as a square root \"undoes\" the squaring function, a logarithm undoes an exponential function.  A Logarithm is an Exponent  Suppose that a colony of bacteria doubles in size every day. If the colony starts with 50 bacteria, how long will it be before there are 800 bacteria?  We answer questions of this type by writing and solving an exponential equation. The initial value of the population is , and the growth factor is . Thus, the function gives the number of bacteria present on day , and we must solve the equation We are looking for an unknown exponent on base 2. Dividing both sides by 50 yields This equation asks the question: \"To what power must we raise 2 in order to get 16?\"  Because , we see that the solution of the equation is . You can check that solves the original problem: The unknown exponent that solves the equation is called the base logarithm logarithm of . The exponent in this case is , and we write this fact as In other words, we solved an exponential equation by computing a logarithm. We make the following definition.  Definition of Logarithm logarithm base of a logarithm exponent logarithm base  For and ,  the base logarithm of base is the exponent to which must be raised in order to yield .  We write the logarithm as .   Some logarithms, like some square roots, are easy to evaluate, while others require a calculator. We'll start with the easy ones.  Here are some examples of logarithms.  because  because  because  because    We see that in each example the logarithm is the exponent we need on the given base.  To review writing radicals with exponents, see Section 7.3.1 of the Toolkit.  So the request to compute a logarithm really says \"Find me the exponent!\"  Practice 1 Find each logarithm.   (What exponent on 3 gives me 81?)  (What exponent on 10 gives me ?)     From the definition of a logarithm and the examples above, we see that the following two statements are equivalent.  Logarithms and Exponents: Conversion Equations conversion equations logarithm conversion equations  If , , and ,   This equivalence tells us that the logarithm, , is the same as the exponent in . We see again that a logarithm is an exponent ; it is the exponent to which must be raised to yield .  For example, to convert the equation to exponential form, we note that the base is and the logarithm is , so the exponent on base 5 will be 3, like this: .  The conversion equations allow us to convert from logarithmic to exponential form, or vice versa. It will help you to become familiar with the conversion, because we will use it frequently.  As special cases of the equivalence above, we can compute the following useful logarithms.  Some Useful Logarithms logarithm some useful  For any base ,   Here are some more examples. Once again, we are looking for the exponent on the given base to get .   because  because  because, well,   QuickCheck 1   because   because    If then     Logs and Exponential Equations  We use logarithms to solve exponential equations, just as we use square roots to solve quadratic equations. Consider the two equations We solve the first equation by taking a square root, and we solve the second equation by computing a logarithm: The operation of taking a base logarithm is the inverse operation for raising the base to a power, just as extracting square roots is the inverse of squaring a number.  Every exponential equation can be rewritten in logarithmic form by using the conversion equations. Thus, are equivalent statements, just as are equivalent statements. Rewriting an equation in logarithmic form is a basic strategy for finding its solution.  Rewrite each equation in logarithmic form.       First identify the base , and then the exponent or logarithm . Use the conversion equations to rewrite in the form .  The base is and the exponent is Thus, .  The base is and the exponent is Thus, .

We can solve an exponential equation by converting the equation to logarithmic form.  Solve each equation by converting to logarithmic form.        In this case we can see by inspection that the solution is , or  The log form is , which is not easy to evaluate without a calculator.

QuickCheck 2 Answer the question or complete the statement.  What is the inverse operation for squaring a number?  What is the inverse operation for raising to a power?  Every exponential equation can be rewritten in logarithmic form by using the .  A logarithm is an unknown .    Approximating Logarithms  Now let's consider computing logarithms that are not obvious by inspection. Suppose we would like to solve the equation The solution of this equation is , but can we find a decimal approximation for this value? There is no integer power of 2 that equals 26, because So must be between 4 and 5. We can use trial and error to find the value of to the nearest tenth. Use your calculator to make a table of values for , starting with and using increments of 0.1.                                         From the table we see that is between and , and is closer to .

Round your answer to three decimal places.       Base 10 Logarithms  Some logarithms are used so frequently in applications that their values are programmed into scientific and graphing calculators. These are the base 10 logarithms, such as Base 10 logarithms are called common logarithms common logarithms base 10 logarithms common logarithms logarithms common (base 10) , and the subscript 10 is often omitted, so that is understood to mean .  QuickCheck 3 If , which statement(s) about are true?    is between 20 and 30  is between 100 and 1000    To evaluate a base 10 logarithm, we use the LOG key on a calculator. Many logarithms are irrational numbers, and the calculator gives as many digits as its display allows. We can then round off to the desired accuracy.  Approximate the following logarithms to 2 decimal places.      The keying sequence LOG   ) ENTER yields , so .  The keying sequence LOG   )  ENTER yields , so .   We can check the approximations found in with our conversion equations. Remember that a logarithm is an exponent, and in this example the base is 10. We find that so our approximations are reasonable, although you can see that rounding a logarithm to 2 decimal places does lose some accuracy.  For this reason, rounding logarithms to 4 decimal places is customary.  Practice 5 Approximate the logarithms to four decimal places.            QuickCheck 4 Decide whether each statement is true or false.  The LOG key on a calculator computes logarithms base 2.  is a number between 2 and 3.  Rounding a logarithm to two decimal places gives very accurate results.  The value of is also the solution of .    Solving Exponential Equations  We can now solve any exponential equation with base 10.  Solve the equation   First, we isolate the power of 10: We subtract 95 from both sides of the equation and divide by to obtain Next, we convert the equation to logarithmic form as Solving for yields We can evaluate this expression on the calculator by entering  LOG   )    ENTER  which yields . Thus, to four decimal places, .  Do not omit the parenthesis when entering the expression in . Without the parenthesis, you are calculating . You can check that this is not the same as .  To solve exponential equations involving powers of 10, we can use the following steps.  Steps for Solving Exponential Equations exponential equation solving exponential equation solving with logarithms   Isolate the power on one side of the equation.  Rewrite the equation in logarithmic form.  Use a calculator, if necessary, to evaluate the logarithm.  Solve for the variable.   QuickCheck 5 What is the first step in solving the equation ?   Multiply 5 times 10.  Take the log of both sides.  Get zero on one side of the equation.  Divide both sides by 5.   Practice 6 Solve the equation .     Application to Exponential Models  We have seen that exponential functions are used to describe some applications of growth and decay, . There are two common questions that arise in connection with exponential models:  Given a value of , what is the corresponding value of ?  Given a value of , what is the corresponding value of ?  To answer the first question, we evaluate the function at the appropriate value. To answer the second question, we must solve an exponential equation, and this usually involves logarithms.  The value of a large tractor originally worth $30,000 depreciates exponentially according to the formula where is in years. When will the tractor be worth half its original value?  We want to find the value of for which . That is, we want to solve the equation Once we have isolated the power, we convert the equation to logarithmic form.

For in 1994, the growth law was [Source: Los Angeles Times, August 20, 1999]   What percent of American homes had computers in 1994?  If the percentage of homes with computers continued to grow at the same rate, when did 90% of American homes have a computer?  Do you think that the function will continue to model the percentage of American homes with computers? Why or why not?   25.85%  (year 2004)  No, the percent of homes with computers cannot exceed 100%.   At this stage, it seems we will only be able to solve exponential equations in which the base is 10. However, we will see in future sections how the properties of logarithms enable us to solve exponential equations with any base.

  "body": "Properties of Logarithms  So far we've seen that taking a logarithm is the opposite or inverse of raising to a power, so that we can use logarithms to solve exponential equations. And with the help of a calculator we can use base 10 or \"common\" logarithms to find approximate solutions to equations in base 10. Now we'll see how to use properties of logarithms to solve exponential equations with any base.  Logarithms and Exponents  Because logarithms are actually exponents, they have several properties that can be derived from the laws of exponents. Here are the laws we will need at present.   To review some applications of the laws of exponents, see Section 7.4.1 of the Toolkit.   To multiply two powers with the same base, add the exponents and leave the base unchanged.  To divide two powers with the same base, subtract the exponents and leave the base unchanged.  To raise a power to a power, keep the same base and multiply the exponents.   Each of these laws corresponds to a property of logarithms.  Properties of Logarithms logarithm properties  If and and , then      To help you see why these properties work, study the examples below, keeping in mind that a logarithm is an exponent.   Property (1):  Property (2):  Property (3):   QuickCheck 1 Which of the statements below are true?         Using the Properties of Logarithms  Of course, these properties are useful not so much for computing logs but rather for simplifying expressions that contain variables. We will use them to solve exponential equations. But first, we will practice applying the properties.  At this point, it may also be helpful to compare the distributive law with the log properties. See Section 7.4.2 of the Toolkit.  Write as an expression in simpler logs.  First, we write using a fractional exponent: Thus, .  Practice 1 Write as an expression in simpler logs.  We can also use the properties of logarithms to combine sums and differences of logarithms into one logarithm.  Express as a single logarithm with a coefficient of .  We begin by applying Property (2) to combine the logs. Thus, .  Be careful when using the properties of logarithms! Compare the statements below:   but    but    QuickCheck 2 Decide whether each statement is true or false.  The log of a product is equal to the sum of the logs of the factors.  The log of a quotient is the equal to the difference of the logs.  The log of a power is equal to the exponent times the log of the base.  The distributive law applies to the operation of taking a logarithm of a sum or difference.    Solving Exponential Equations exponential equation solving with logarithms  By using Property (3), we can now solve exponential equations in which the base is not 10. For example, to solve the equation we could rewrite the equation in logarithmic form to obtain the exact solution However, we cannot evaluate ; there is no \"log base 5 button\" on the calculator. If we want a decimal approximation for the solution, we begin by taking the base 10 logarithm of both sides, even though the base of the power is not 10. This gives us Then we use Property (3) to rewrite the left side as and divide both sides by to get On your calculator, enter the sequence  LOG   )   LOG   )  ENTER  to find that .  Note how using Property (3) allows us to solve the equation above: The variable, , is no longer in the exponent, and it is multiplied by a constant, .  Do not confuse the expression with ; they are not the same! Although We cannot simplify ; we must evaluate it as  Solve   First we divide both sides by 80 to isolate the power. Next, we take the base 10 logarithm of both sides of the equation and use Property (3) to get On the right side of the equation, is multiplied by two constants, and . So, to solve for we must divide both sides of the equation by . We use a calculator to evaluate the answer: (On your calculator, remember to enclose the entire denominator, , in parentheses.)  To compare solving exponential equations and power equations, see Section 7.4.3 of the Toolkit.  In the previous example, do not try to simplify Remember that the order of operations tells us to compute the power before multiplying by 80. To solve the equation, we must first isolate the power with the variable exponent.  Practice 3 Solve  By using the properties of logarithms, we can now solve equations that arise in exponential growth and decay models, no matter what base the exponential function uses.  The population of Silicon City was 6500 in 1990 and has been tripling every 12 years. When will the population reach 75,000?  The population of Silicon City grows according to the formula where is the number of years after. We want to find the value of for which ; that is, we want to solve the equation To isolate the power, we divide both sides by 6500 to get Now we can take the base 10 logarithm of both sides and solve for . We use a calculator to evaluate the answer, . The population of Silicon City will reach 75,000 about 27 years after 1990, or in 2017.  Practice 4 The volume of traffic on U.S. highways is growing by 2.7% per year. (Source: Time , Jan. 25, 1999)   Write a formula for the volume, , of traffic as a function of time, using for the current volume.  How long will it take the volume of traffic to double?  Hint: Find the value of that gives .    about 26 years   QuickCheck 3 The first step for solving each equation below is incorrect . Replace it with the correct step.         Solving Formulas  We can also solve formulas involving exponential or logarithmic expressions for one variable in terms of the others.  Solve for . ( and .)  First, we divide both sides by to isolate the power. Then we write the exponential equation in logarithmic form:  Practice 5  Solve for .  Follow the steps:  Divide both sides by .  Rewrite in exponential form.  Solve for .  One final note about finding approximate values for logarithms. As we saw earlier, the solution of the equation is , but by taking the log base 10 of both sides of the equation we obtained the solution in the form Because these two expressions for the solution must be equal, we have This equation is an example of the change of base formula.  Change of Base Formula  For positive values of , and , and ,  We can use the change of base formula to convert any logarithm to base 10, or any other convenient base.

  "body": "Exponential Models  Using what we have learned about exponential functions and logarithms, we can now explore some exponential models. In this secction we'll see how to fit an exponential function to data and how to use doubling time and half-life.  Fitting an Exponential Function through Two Points  To write a formula for an exponential function , we need to know the initial value, initial value , and the growth or decay factor, . We can find these two parameters if we know any two function values.  Find an exponential function that has the values and .  We would like to find values of and so that the given function values satisfy . By substituting the function values into the formula, we can write two equations. We now have a system of equations in the two unknowns and : but it is not a linear system. We can solve the system by the method of elimination, but instead of adding the equations, we will divide one of the equations by the other. Note that by dividing the two equations, we eliminated , and we can now solve for . Next we substitute into either of the two equations and solve for . Thus, and , and the function is .  Knowing only two points on the graph of is not enough to tell us what kind of function is. Through the two points in , we can also fit a linear function or a power function.  You can check that the three functions below all satisfy and . The graphs of the functions are shown at right.  three functions through the same two points   However, if we already know that we are looking for an exponential function, we can follow the steps below to find its formula. This method is sometimes called the ratio method ratio method . (Of course, if one of the known function values is the initial value, we can find without resorting to the ratio method.)   To find an exponential function through two points: exponential function finding a formula     Use the coordinates of the points to write two equations in and .   Divide one equation by the other to eliminate .  Solve for .  Substitute into either equation and solve for .     Practice 1 Use the ratio method to find an exponential function whose graph includes the points and .  QuickCheck 1 You have written a system of equations to fit an exponential function through two points. What is the next step?   Calculate the slope.  Subtract one equation from the other.  Divide one equation by the other.  Take the log of both sides.   We can use the ratio method to find an exponential growth or decay model if we know two function values.  The unit of currency in Ghana is the cedi, denoted by ¢. Beginning in 1986, the cedi underwent a period of exponential inflation. In 1993, one U.S. dollar was worth ¢720, and in 1996, the dollar was worth about ¢1620. Find a formula for the number of cedi to the dollar as a function of time since 1986. What was the annual inflation rate during the decade from 1986 to 1996?  We want to find a function for the number of cedi to the dollar, where in 1986. We have two function values, , and , and with these values we can write two equations. We divide the second equation by the first to find Now we can solve this last equation for to get . Finally, we substitute into the first equation to find . Thus, . Finally, recall that to see that the annual inflation rate was 31%.  For help interpreting function notation, see Section 7.5.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 2 The number of earthquakes that occur worldwide is a decreasing exponential function of their magnitude on the Richter scale. Between 2000 and 2005, there were 7480 earthquakes of magnitude 5 and 793 earthquakes of magnitude 6. (Source: National Earthquake Information Center, U.S. Geological Survey)   Find a formula for the number of earthquakes that occurred between 2000 and 2005, , in terms of their magnitude, . (Notice that in this problem is not a function of time; is a function of Richter magnitude .) Round your value for to the nearest million, because greater accuracy is not realistic.  It is difficult to keep an accurate count of small earthquakes. Use your formula to estimate the number of magnitude 1 earthquakes that occurred between 2000 and 2005.  How many earthquakes of magnitude 8 occurred over those five years?        Doubling Time doubling time  Instead of giving the rate of growth of a population, we often specify its rate of growth by giving the time it takes for the population to double. Let us see how those two descriptions are connected.  In 2005, the population of Egypt was 74 million and was growing by 2% per year.  If it continues to grow at the same rate, how long will it take the population of Egypt to double?  How long will it take the population to double again?  Illustrate the results on a graph.    The population of Egypt is growing according to the formula where is in years and is in millions. We would like to know when the population will reach 148 million (twice 74 million), so we solve the equation It will take the population about 35 years to double.  Twice 148 million is 296 million, so we solve the equation It will take the population about 35 years to double again.  A graph of is shown below. Note that the population doubles every 35 years.  graph showing doubling time   In the Example above, notice that the calculations in parts (a) and (b) are identical after the first step, and give the same result, 35 years. In fact, we can start at any time, and it will take the population 35 years to double. We say that 35 years is the doubling time for this population. Every increasing exponential function exponential growth has a constant doubling time. And if a function has a constant doubling time, it must be exponential.  Practice 3 In 2005, the population of Uganda was 26.9 million people and was growing by 3.2% per year.   Write a formula for the population of Uganda as a function of years since 2005.  To the nearest year,how long will it take the population of Uganda to double?  Use your formula from part (a) to verify the doubling time for three doubling periods.   million  22 years  ; , so ;   , so ;   , so   QuickCheck 2 Which of these statements are true?   The doubling time of a population depends on its initial value.  An increasing exponential function has a constant doubling time.  The doubling time is twice the percent growth rate.  The doubling time is half the percent growth rate.   If we know the doubling time for a population, we can immediately write down its growth law. Because the population of Egypt doubles in 35 years, we can write In this form, the growth factor for the population is , and you can check that, to five decimal places, .  Doubling Time doubling time  If is the doubling time for an exponential function , then   So, from knowing the doubling time, we can easily find the growth rate of a population.  At its current rate of growth, the population of the United States will double in 115.87 years.   Write a formula for the population of the United States as a function of time.  What is the annual percent growth rate of the population?    The current population of the United States is not given, so we represent it by . With expressed in years, the formula is then  We write in the form to see that the growth factor is , or 1.006. For exponential growth, , so , or 0.6%.    Practice 4 At its current rate of growth, the population of Mexico will double in 36.8 years. What is its annual percent rate of growth? 1.9%  Half-Life half-life  The half-life half-life of a decreasing exponential function is the time it takes for the output to decrease to half its original value. For example, the half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The half-life of a drug is the time it takes for half of the drug to be eliminated from the body. Like the doubling time, the half-life is constant for a particular function; no matter where you start, it takes the same amount of time to reach half that value.  If you take mg of ibuprofen to relieve sore muscles, the amount of the drug left in your body after hours is .  What is the half-life of ibuprofen?  When will 50 mg of ibuprofen remain in your body?  Use the half-life to sketch a graph of .    To find the half-life, we calculate the time elapsed when only half the original amount, or 100 mg, is left. The half-life is 2.2 hours.  After 2.2 hours, 100 mg of ibuprofen is left in the body. After another 2.2 hours, half of that amount, or 50 mg, is left. Thus, 50 mg remain after 4.4 hours.  We locate multiples of 2.2 hours on the horizontal axis. After each interval of 2.2 hours, the amount of ibuprofen is reduced to half its previous value. The graph is shown below.   graph showing half-life                   Practice 5 Alcohol is eliminated from the body at a rate of 15% per hour.   Write a decay formula for the amount of alcohol remaining in the body, using for the initial amount of alcohol.  What is the half-life of alcohol in the body?    4.3 hours   QuickCheck 3 The half-life of DDT is 15 years. This means that:   30 pounds of DDT dissolve in one year.  100 pounds of DDT dissolve in 30 years.  After 30 years, 100 pounds of DDT is reduced to 25 pounds.  Each half-pound of DDT takes 15 years to dissolve.   Just as we can write an exponential growth law in terms of its doubling time, we can use the half-life to write a formula for exponential decay. exponential decay For example, the half-life of ibuprofen is 2.2 hours, so every 2.2 hours the amount remaining is reduced by a factor of 0.5. After hours a 200-mg dose will be reduced to Once again, you can check that this formula is equivalent to the decay function given in the previous Example.  Half-Life half-life  If is the half-life for an exponential function , then   Radioactive isotopes are molecules that decay into more stable molecules, emitting radiation in the process. Although radiation in large doses is harmful to living things, radioactive isotopes are useful as tracers in medicine and industry, and as treatment against cancer. The decay laws for radioactive isotopes are often given in terms of their half-lives.  Cobalt-60 is used in cold pasteurization to sterilize certain types of food. Gamma rays emitted by the isotope during radioactive decay kill any bacteria present without damaging the food. The half-life of cobalt-60 is 5.27 years.   Write a decay law for cobalt-60.  What is the annual decay rate for cobalt-60?    We let denote the amount of cobalt-60 left after years, and let denote the initial amount. Every 5.27 years, is reduced by a factor of 0.5, so  We rewrite the decay law in the form as follows: Thus, , so , or 12.32%.   For more examples of doubling time and half-life, see Section 7.5.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6 Cesium-137, with a half-life of 30 years, is one of the most dangerous by-products of nuclear fission. What is the annual decay rate for cesium-137? 2.28%  QuickCheck 4 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   Every increasing exponential function has a constant doubling time.  If the doubling time of a population is 5 years, then its growth factor is given by .  The half-life of a substance is half the time it takes for all of the substance to decay.  We can sketch the graph of an exponential decay function if we know its half-life and initial value.     Problem Set 7.5  Warm Up  For Problems 1-4, solve.

Then find the percent growth or decay rate.  A population starts with 2000 and has a doubling time of 5 years. 14.9%  You have 10 grams of a radioactive isotope whose half-life is 42 years.  A certain medication has a half-life of 18 hours in the body. You are given an initial dose of mg. 3.8%  The doubling time of a certain financial investment is 8 years. You invest an amount .   In 1798, the English political economist Thomas R. Malthus claimed that human populations, unchecked by environmental or social constraints, double every 25 years, regardless of the initial population size.  Write a growth law for human populations under these conditions.  What is the growth rate in unconstrained conditions?    2.81%   David Sifry observed in 2005 that over the previous two years, the number of Weblogs, or blogs, was doubling every 5 months. (Source: www.sifry.com\/alerts\/archives)  Write a formula for the number of blogs years after January 2005, assuming it continues to grow at the same rate.  What is the growth rate for the number of blogs?   Radioactive potassium-42, which is used by cardiologists as a tracer, decays at a rate of 5.4% per hour.  Find the half-life of potassium-42.  How long will it take for three-fourths of the sample to decay? For seven-eighths of the sample?  Suppose you start with 400 milligrams of potassium-42. Using your answers to (a) and (b), make a rough sketch of the decay function.   hours  25 hours  decay   Caffeine leaves the body at a rate of 15.6% each hour. Your first cup of coffee in the morning has 100 mg of caffeine.  How long will it take before you have 50 mg of that caffeine in your body?  How long will it take before you have 25 mg of that caffeine in your body?  Using your answers to (a) and (b), make a rough sketch of the decay function.   Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) is a pesticide that was used in the middle decades of the twentieth century to control malaria. After 1945, it was also widely used on crops in the United States, and as much as one ton might be sprayed on a single cotton field. However, after the toxic effects of DDT on the environment began to appear, the chemical was banned in 1972.  A common estimate for the half-life of DDT in the soil is 15 years. Write a decay law for DDT in the soil.  In 1970, many soil samples in the United States contained about 0.5 mg of DDT per kg of soil. The NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) safe level for DDT in the soil is 0.008 mg\/kg. When will DDT content in the soil be reduced to a safe level?    After 89.5 years, or in 2060  In 1986, the inflation rate in Bolivia was 8000% annually. The unit of currency in Bolivia is the boliviano.  Write a formula for the price of an item as a function of time. Let be its initial price.  How long did it take for prices to double? Give both an exact value and a decimal approximation rounded to two decimal places.  Suppose bolivianos. Graph your function in the window , , , .  Use intersect to verify that the price of the item doubles from 5 to 10 bolivianos, from 10 to 20, and from 20 to 40 in equal periods of time.   In Problems 25 and 26,  Write a decay law for the isotope.  Use the decay law to answer the question. (Round to the nearest ten years.)   In living organisms, carbon-14 occurs with a fixed ratio to nonradioactive carbon-12. After a plant or animal dies, the carbon-14 decays into stable carbon with a halflife of 5730 years. When samples from the Shroud of Turin were analyzed in 1988, they were found to have 91.2% of their original carbon-14. How old were those samples in 1988?   About 760 years old   Rubidium-strontium radioactive dating is used in geologic studies to measure the age of minerals. Rubidium-87 decays into strontium-87 with a half-life of 48.8 billion years.

Logarithms and Exponents: Conversion Equations  If , , and ,  Some Useful Logarithms  For any base ,   We use logarithms to solve exponential equations, just as we use square roots to solve quadratic equations. The operation of taking a base logarithm is the inverse of raising the base to a power, just as extracting square roots is the inverse of squaring a number.  Steps for Solving Base 10 Exponential Equations   Isolate the power on one side of the equation.  Rewrite the equation in logarithmic form.  Use a calculator, if necessary, to evaluate the logarithm.  Solve for the variable.

  "body": "Polynomial Functions  Introduction  As noted in the introduction to this chapter, the graphs of polynomial functions have a variety of different shapes, so they are useful for modeling curves. In addition, polynomials are easy to evaluate, so they can be used to compute approximate values for other functions, such as exponentials and logarithms. In this section we'll learn some of the algebraic techniques for studying and using polynomials.   What are Polynomials?  We have already encountered some examples of polynomial functions. Linear functions, and quadratic functions are special cases of polynomial functions. Polynomials can also include terms with higher powers of the variable. Here are some examples. In general, we make the following definition.  Polynomial Function  A polynomial function polynomial function function polynomial has the form where , , , , are constants and .  The coefficient of the highest power term is called the lead coefficient, lead coefficient polynomial lead coefficient and the highest power is the degree degree of the polyomial.  Each of the polynomials above is written in descending powers descending powers polynomial descending powers , which means that the highest-degree degree (of a polynomial) term comes first, and the degrees of the terms decrease from largest to smallest. Sometimes it is useful to write a polynomial in ascending powers ascending powers polynomial ascending powers , so that the degrees of the terms increase. For example, the polynomial above would be written as in ascending powers.  QuickCheck 1 What is the lead coefficient of a polynomial?   The first coefficient  The constant term  The largest coefficient  The coefficient of the highest power term   We can evaluate polynomials just as we do for any other function.  Evaluate the polynomial at and at .   We substitute the values given for and follow the order of operations.    Here is a graph of the polynomial.  x-cubed-.5xsquared-4x+2    Products of Polynomials polynomial products of  In of Section 3.2 we solved a quadratic equation by factoring. As another example, because the solutions of the equation are and . But now notice that the product of the two linear polynomials and is a quadratic polynomial. Or, in other words, the product of two first-degree polynomials gives us a second-degree polynomial. In fact, whenever we multiply two or more polynomials together, we get another polynomial of higher degree.  Compute the products.      diagram of polynomial multiplication  For help multiplying polynomials, see Section 8.1.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Multiply  In part (a) of the Example above, we multiplied a polynomial of degree one by a polynomial of degree three, and the product was a polynomial of degree four. In part (b) of the Example, the product of three first-degree polynomials is a third-degree polynomial.  Degree of a Product degree (of a polynomial) of a product  The degree of a product of non-zero polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the factors. That is:  If has degree and has degree , then their product has degree .  Let , and .  What is the degree of their product? What is the coefficient of the lead term?  Find the coefficient of the -term of the product.    The degree of is 4, and the degree of is 3, so the degree of their product is . The only degree 7 term of the product is , which has coefficient 15.  In the product, each term of is multiplied by each term of . How might we isolate the products that result in terms sof degree 3? We get degree 3 terms by multiplying together terms of degree 0 and 3, or of degree 1 and 2. For these polynomials, the possible combinations are:      Product                   The sum of the third-degree terms of the product is , with coefficient 34.   Practice 2 Find the coefficient of the fourth-degree term of the product of and .  QuickCheck 2 What is the linear term of the product ?         Modeling with Polynomials polynomial modeling with  Polynomials are used to model many variable relationships, including volume and surface area. surface area  A closed box has a square base of length and width inches and a height of inches, as shown at right.  box with height x-6 inches with both length and width of x inches   Write a polynomial function that gives the surface area of the box in terms of the dimensions of the base.  What is the surface area of a box of length and width 18 inches?  Write a polynomial function for the volume of the box.    The surface area of a box is the sum of the areas of its six faces, Substituting for and , and for gives us  We evaluate the polynomial for to find  You probably recall that the formula for the volume of a box is , the product of its length, width, and height. So the box has volume .   Practice 3  An empty reflecting pool is feet deep. It is feet longer than it is wide, as illustrated at right.   Write a polynomial function that gives the surface area of the empty pool.  Write a polynomial function for the volume of the pool.   rectangular hole 3 ft deep, x feet wide, x+8 ft long      Cubic Polynomials  The volume of the box in Example 9, , is an example of a cubic polynomial  polynomial cubic , a polynomial of degree 3. Cubic polynomials are often used in economics to model cost functions. The cost of producing items is an increasing function of , but its rate of increase is usually not constant.  Pegasus Printing, Ltd. is launching a new magazine. The cost of printing thousand copies is given by  What are the fixed costs , that is, the costs incurred before any copies are printed?  Graph the cost function in the window below and describe the graph.  How many copies can be printed for $1200?  What does the concavity of the graph tell you about the cost function? (See to review concavity.)    Fixed costs are given by , or $250. The fixed costs include expenses like utility bills that must be paid even if no magazines are produced.  The graph is shown in figure (a). It is increasing from a vertical intercept of 250. The graph is concave down for approximately, and concave up for .  GC graphs of a cubic cost function  We must solve the equation We will solve the equation graphically, as shown in figure (b). Graph along with the cost function, and use the intersect command to find the intersection point of the graphs, . when is about 15,319, so 15,319 copies can be printed for $1200.  Although the cost is always increasing, it increases very slowly from about to about . The flattening of the graph in this interval is a result of economy of scale : By buying supplies in bulk and using time efficiently, the cost per magazine can be minimized. However, if the production level is too large, costs begin to rise rapidly again.   In c, we solved a cubic equation graphically. There is a cubic formula, cubic formula analogous to the quadratic formula, that allows us to solve cubic equations polynomial cubic algebraically, but it is complicated and not often used in applications.  Cubic polynomials polynomial cubic are also used to model smooth curves connecting given points. Such a curve is called a cubic spline cubic spline .  Practice 4 Leon is flying his plane to Au Gres, Michigan. He maintains a constant altitude until he passes over a marker just outside the neighboring town of Omer, when he begins his descent for landing. During the descent, his altitude, in feet, is given by where is the number of miles Leon has traveled since passing over the marker in Omer.   What is Leon's altitude when he begins his descent?  Graph in the window  Use the Trace feature to discover how far from Omer Leon will travel before landing. (In other words, how far is Au Gres from Omer?)

Approximations with Polynomials  Did you ever wonder how your calculator obtains decimal values for numbers such as or ? One way to do it is to use a polynomial. Functions such as and can be approximated by polynomials, and the higher the degree of the polynomial, the better the approximation. Because evaluating a polynomial uses only addition and multiplication, calculators and computers can perform the calculations quickly and give us decimal values with great accuracy.   Evaluate the polynomial at to find an approximation for .  Use a calculator to evaluate . How close is your approximation from part (a)?    Substituting into we find  A calculator returns the value . Our approximation is accurate to four decimal places. One can use a polynomial of higher degree to obtain an approximation with greater accuracy.   Practice 5  Evaluate the polynomial at to find an approximation for .  Use a calculator to evaluate . How close is your approximation from part (a)?    The approximation is accurate to two decimal places.    Special Products  As we saw in Chapter 3 , many quadratic polynomials can be factored into a product of two linear expressions, and these factors give us information about the roots of a quadratic equation or the -intercepts of its graph. The same is true of cubic polynomials, so we will take a brief look at how they can be factored.  To begin, recall the following special products involving quadratic expressions.  Special Products of Binomials special products of binomials binomial special products of polynomial quadratic    To review products of binomials, see Section 8.1.2 of the Toolkit.  There are also special products resulting in cubic polynomials. In the Homework problems, you will be asked to verify the following products.  Cube of a Binomial binomial cube of cube of a binomial polynomial cubic      If you become familiar with these general forms, you can use them as patterns to find specific examples of such products.  Write as a polynomial.  Use product above, with replaced by and replaced by .   For help using formulas, see Section 8.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Of course, we can also expand the product simply by polynomial multiplication and arrive at the same answer.  Practice 6 Write as a polynomial.  QuickCheck 4 Fill in the blanks.   The coefficient of the highest power term of a polynomial is called the .  The largest exponent in a polynomial is called the of the polynomial.

  "body": "Algebraic Fractions  Introduction  In applications, variables may occur in the numerator or denominator of a fraction, or both. For example, the time it takes for the Moon to eclipse the Sun is given by the formula where the variables give the diameter of the Sun and the distances of the Moon and Sun from Earth. The total resistance of two appliances with resistances and connected in parallel is given by  These two formulas involve simple poynomials in more than one variable. Let's start our study of fractions with expressions that include only one variable.  Algebraic Fraction  An algebraic fraction algebraic fraction (or rational expression rational expression rational expression algebraic fraction , as they are sometimes called) is a fraction in which both numerator and denominator are polynomials.  Here are some examples of algebraic fractions: We can evaluate algebraic fractions just as we evaluate any other algebraic expression.  If we try to evaluate the fraction for , we get or , which is undefined. When working with fractions, we must exclude any values of the variable that make the denominators equal to zero.   Reducing Fractions reducing fractions  You'll recall from your study of arithmetic that we can reduce fraction reducing reducing fractions a fraction if we can divide both numerator and denominator by a common factor common factor fraction common factor common factor fraction . In algebra, it is helpful to think of factoring out the common factor first. For example, where we have divided both numerator and denominator by 9. The new fraction has the same value as the old one, namely 0.75, but it is simpler (the numbers are smaller.) Reducing is an application of the Fundamental Principle of Fractions.  Fundamental Principle of Fractions fraction fundamental principal fundamental principal of fractions reducing fractions  We can multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero factor, and the new fraction will be equivalent to the old one.  Reduce  The common factor for numerator and denominator is . We factor from the numerator and denominator, then divide by the common factor.   Practice 1 Reduce  When we cancel common factors, we are dividing . Because division is the inverse or opposite operation for multiplication, we can cancel common factors , but we cannot cancel common terms .  Use your calculator to decide which calculation is correct.    We can cancel the 4's in part (a), because they are factors of numerator and denominator.  We cannot cancel the 4's in part (b), because they are terms.  You can verify that , but .   QuickCheck 1 Fill in the blanks to complete each statement.   An algebraic fraction is undefined when the is .  \"Canceling\" common factors uses the operation of .  Terms are expressions that are or .  When we reduce a fraction, the new fraction is to the old one.   Practice 2 Which calculation is correct? Choose a value for and use your calculator to verify your answer.     (a)  If the numerator or denominator of the fraction contains more than one term, it is especially important to factor before reducing , so that numerator and denominator are written as products of factors, instead of as sums of terms.  Reduce each fraction.     First we factor the numerator and denominator. Then we divide numerator and denominator by any common factors.      To refresh your factoring skills, see Section 8.2.1 of the Toolkit.  We cannot cancel the 4's in part (a) of the Example above, because 4 is not a factor of the entire numerator. Thus, In part (b) of the Example, we cannot cancel the 3's, because they are terms and not factors. Thus,   Practice 3 Explain why each calculation is incorrect.      3 is not a factor of numerator or denominator  2 is not a factor of the numerator   We summarize the procedure for reducing algebraic fractions as follows.  To reduce an algebraic fraction algebraic fraction reducing fraction reducing an algebraic fraction reducing fractions   Factor the numerator and the denominator.  Divide the numerator and denominator by any common factors.   Reduce each fraction.     We first factor the numerator and denominator completely. Then we divide numerator and denominator by the common factors 3 and . We must cancel the entire expression from numerator and denominator (we cannot cancel the 's or the 4's separately!). All the factors are canceled from the numerator, so we replace them by 1, because any expression divided by itself is 1.  The numerator of the fraction is a difference of two cubes, and the denominator is a difference of two squares. We factor each to obtain We cancel the factor from top and bottom, to get Because we cannot factor any further, we cannot reduce the fraction any further.   QuickCheck 2 Fill in the blanks to complete each statement.   If we want to cancel an expression from a fraction, we must be able to it from numerator and denominator.  When we factor an expression, we write it as a .  If a factor appears in both numerator and denominator, it is called a factor.  If all the factors in the numerator or denominator cancel out, we replace it by .   Practice 4 Reduce each fraction.       Keep in mind that the reduced form is equivalent to the original form of the fraction. If we evaluate the original form and the reduced form at the same value of the variable, the results are equal.  Verify that is equal to for .  We evaluate each fraction at . and   Practice 5 If you evaluate for and for , what answer do you expect to get?  Hint: see   Opposite of a Binomial binomial opposite of opposite of a binomial  Any number (except zero) divided by itself is 1, and any number divided by its opposite is . For example, The same is true for binomials and other algebraic expressions. The opposite of an expression can be found by multiplying it by . Thus, the opposite of is and so Here are some examples of opposites. We can cancel opposites when we reduce fractions.  Reduce    We first factor the numerator and denominator. We see that is the opposite of , that is, . Thus,   For more about the opposite of a binomial, see Section 8.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 6 Reduce if possible.         1  cannot be reduced   cannot be reduced    Rational Functions rational function function rational  Rational Function  A rational function rational function is a function defined by an algebraic fraction. That is, it has the form where and are polynomials. A rational function is undefined at any -values where .  Francine is planning a 60-mile training flight through the desert on her cycle-plane, a pedal-driven aircraft. If there is no wind, she can pedal at an average speed of 15 miles per hour, so she can complete the flight in 4 hours.  If there is a headwind of miles per hour, it will take Francine longer to fly 60 miles. Express the time it will take to complete the training flight as a function of .  Make a table of values for the function.  Graph the function and explain what it tells you about the time Francine should allot for the flight.    If there is a headwind of miles per hour, Francine's ground speed will be miles per hour. Using the fact that , we find that the time needed for the flight will be  We evaluate the function for several values of , as shown in the table below.                    For example, if the headwind is miles per hour, then Francine's effective speed is only 10 miles per hour, and it will take her 6 hours to fly the 60 miles. The table shows that as the speed of the headwind increases, the time required for the flight increases also.  The graph of the function is shown below. You can use your calculator with the window to verify the graph. In particular, the point lies on the graph. This point tells us that if there is no wind, Francine can fly 60 miles in 4 hours, as we calculated earlier.  graph showing time to complete trip vs speed of headwind  The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to 15 miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly 15 miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at .  What about negative values for ? If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine's flying time should decrease for negative -values. For example, if , there is a tailwind of 5 miles per hour, so Francine's effective speed is 20 miles per hour, and she can complete the flight in 3 hours. As the tailwind gets stronger (that is, as we move farther to the left in the -direction), Francine's flying time continues to decrease, and the graph approaches the -axis.   The vertical dashed line at on the graph of is a vertical asymptote asymptote vertical vertical asymptote for the graph. We first encountered asymptotes in when we studied the graph of . Locating the vertical asymptotes of a rational function is an important part of determining the shape of the graph.  Practice 7 EarthCare decides to sell T-shirts to raise money. The company makes an initial investment of $100 to pay for the design of the T-shirt and to set up the printing process. After that, the T-shirts cost $5 each for labor and materials.   Express the average cost, , per T-shirt as a function of the number of T-shirts EarthCare produces.  Make a table of values for the function.                    Graph the function and explain what it tells you about the cost of the T-shirts.                      graph of average cost of production  As the number of T-shirts increases, the average cost per shirt decreases, but eventually levels off and approaches $5 per T-shirt.   In Practice 7 , the horizontal line is a horizontal asymptote asymptote horizontal horizontal asymptote for the graph of the function. As increases, the graph approaches the line but will never actually meet it. The average price per T-shirt will always be slightly more than $5. Horizontal asymptotes are also important in sketching the graphs of rational functions.  For more about asymptotes, see Section 8.2.3 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 3 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.  A vertical asymptote occurs where a rational function is undefined.  A horizontal asymptote is a line that the graph of a rational function approaches as increases.  The algebraic fraction is never equal to zero.

In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to 15 miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly 15 miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at .  What about negative values for ? If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine's flying time should decrease for negative -values.

  "body": "Operations on Algebraic Fractions  In this section we review the rules for operations on fractions and see how to apply those rules to algebraic fractions. The focus of the discussion will be to sharpen algebraic skills and improve understanding of the reasoning behind them.  Products of Fractions  To multiply two fractions together, we multiply their numerators together and then multiply their denominators together.  Product of Fractions product of fractions  If and , then  To see why this rule works, consider an example. Suppose you make a chocolate cake for the Math Club bake sale, but at the end of the day of the cake is left in the pan. The remaining cake is shown in figure (a).   subdivided rectangles  You decide to take of the remaining cake home, and give the rest to your math professor. You cut the remaining cake into thirds, as shown in figure (b). How much of the original cake are you taking home? Your share is If you look at figure (b), you can see that you are taking home 8 pieces of cake, and that the original cake would have had 15 pieces of the same size. This means that your share is of the original cake.  We get the same answer if we use the rule above.  There is a shortcut for multiplying fractions that allows us to reduce the answer before we multiply. We do this by dividing out any common factors in a numerator and a denominator. For example, or   For more examples of multiplying fractions, see Section 8.3.1 of the Toolkit.  To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we write the whole number with 1 as denominator. The same applies to the product of an algebraic fraction and any nonfractional expression. For example,   Quotients of Fractions quotient of fractions fraction dividing  To divide one fraction by another, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. For example, We express this rule in symbols as follows.  Quotient of Fractions quotient of fractions fraction dividing  If , then  Why does this rule for division work? Consider a simple example, . This quotient asks us \"how many one-thirds are there in six?\" To see the answer, we can draw six whole units as shown below, and split each into thirds.   rectangles  Because there are 3 thirds in each whole unit, we find , or 18 thirds in six units. The answer is 18. Now, 3 is the reciprocal of , so by using the reciprocal rule, we also find  For a more interesting example, you might try using the figure above to show that (Hint: How many groups of two thirds can you make from six whole units?)  Thus, to divide two algebraic fractions, we take the reciprocal of the divisor (the second fraction) and then follow the rules for multiplying fractions.  For more examples of dividing fractions, see Section 8.3.2 of the Toolkit.   Using Factoring in Multiplication and Division  It is usually easier to cancel any common factors before multiplying. But be careful: if the numerators or denominators have more than one term, we'll need to factor them before looking for common factors!  Multiply  First, we factor each numerator and denominator. Then we divide numerator and denominator by any common factors.   canceling to reduce a fraction  In the previous Example, it would be incorrect to try to cancel any terms of numerators and denominators before factoring each binomial. For example, we cannot cancel into , because they are not factors of the fractions.  We summarize the procedure for multiplying algebraic fractions as follows.  To multiply algebraic fractions: algebraic fraction multiplying product of fractions fraction multiplying fraction multiplying muliplying algebraic fractions   Factor each numerator and denominator.  If any factor appears in both a numerator and a denominator, divide out that factor.  Multiply the remaining factors of the numerator and the remaining factors of the denominator.  Reduce the product if necessary.  Practice 1 Find the product  The procedure for dividing fractions still applies: take the reciprocal of the second fraction, then follow the rules for multiplication.  Divide:  First, we change the operation to multiplication by taking the reciprocal of the second fraction. Now we follow the rules for multiplication: First, we factor each numerator and denominator.  We summarize the procedure for dividing algebraic fractions as follows.  To divide algebraic fractions: algebraic fraction dividing dividing algebraic fractions quotient of fractions fraction dividing   Take the reciprocal of the second fraction and change the operation to multiplication.  Follow the rules for multiplication of fractions.  Practice 2 Divide:   For more examples of multiplying and dividing algebraic fractions, see Section 8.3.3 of the Toolkit.  When working with algebraic fractions, we often leave the denominators in factored form. This makes it easier to add and subtract fractions, and to check whether they can be reducecd.  QuickCheck 1 Fill in the blanks to complete each statement.   The first step in multiplying fractions is to .  It is usually easier to cancel common factors multiplying.  To divide two fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the of the second fraction.  We can write a whole number as a fraction with denominator .    Adding and Subtracting Like Fractions fraction adding or subtracting like fractions adding or subtracting sum or difference of fractions  Fractions with the same denominator are called like fractions like fractions . For example, are like fractions, while are unlike fractions. We can add or subtract like fractions for the same reason that we can add like terms. Just as we can think of the sum as or . The denominators of the terms must be the same because they tell us what kind of quantity we are adding. We can add two quantities if they are the same kind.  When we add like fractions, we add their numerators and keep their denominators the same. For example, The same holds true for all algebraic fractions.  Sum or Difference of Like Fractions sum or difference of fractions fraction adding or subtracting like fractions like fractions adding or subtracting  If , then  Add.     Because these are like fractions, we add their numerators and keep the same denominator.  We combine the numerators over a single denominator.   We summarize our procedure for adding or subtracting like fractions as follows.  To add or subtract like fractions like fractions adding or subtracting fraction adding or subtracting like fractions sum or difference of fractions   Add or subtract the numerators.  Keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.  Practice 3 Add:  We must be careful when subtracting algebraic fractions: A subtraction sign in front of a fraction applies to the entire numerator.  Subtract:  We combine the numerators over a single denominator. We use parentheses around to show that the subtraction applies to the entire numerator. We should always check to see whether the fraction can be reduced. Factor the numerator to find   In the Example above, the subtraction symbol in the numerator applies to both terms of . That is why  QuickCheck 2 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   Like fractions have the same denominator.  To add like fractions, we add their numerators and add their denominators.  A negative sign in front of a fraction changes the sign of both numerator and denominator.  When we subtract fractions, the subtraction symbol applies only to the first term of the numerator.   Practice 4 Subtract:   Unlike Fractions fraction unlike  Let's review the steps for adding or subtracting unlike fractions. For example, to compute the sum we first find the lowest common denominator lowest common denominator LCD lowest common denominator , or LCD , for the two fractions: The smallest number that is a multiple of both 3 and 4 is 12.  Next, we use the fundamental principle of fractions to build each fraction to an equivalent one with denominator 12. First, we multiply by . Because is equal to 1, we have not changed the value of the fraction. 4 is called the building factor building factor for . Similarly, we multiply by . There is nothing mysterious about the building process; we are breaking up each fraction into smaller pieces of the same size so that we can add them together.  subdivided rectangles  Finally, the new fractions are like fractions, and we can add them by combining their numerators. We add or subtract algebraic fractions with the same three steps.  To add or subtract algebraic fraction algebraic fraction adding or subtracting fraction adding or subtracting algebraic fractions sum or difference of fractions   Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.  Build each fraction to an equivalent one with the same denominator.  Add or subtract the resulting like fractions: Add or subtract their numerators, and keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.   Subtract:  Step 1: We find the LCD: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 15 is 30.  Step 2: We build each fraction to an equivalent one with denominator 30. The building factor for the first fraction is , and for the second fraction the building factor is .  Step 3: We subtract the resulting like fractions to obtain  Step 4: Finally, we reduce the fraction.   Practice 5 Add:  QuickCheck 3  Fill in the blanks to complete each statement.   To add unlike fractions, we must first convert them into fractions.  Building a fraction is an application of the .  The LCD is the smallest . of each denominator.  The last step in adding fractions is to .    Finding the Lowest Common Denominator  The lowest common denominator lowest common denominator fraction lowest common denominator lowest common denominator for two or more algebraic fractions is the simplest algebraic expression that is a multiple of each denominator. If neither denominator can be factored, then their LCD is just the product of the two expressions.  Add:   Step 1: The LCD for these fractions is just the product of their denominators, .  Step 2: We build each fraction to an equivalent one with denominator . The building factor for is and the building factor for is . We multiply numerator and denominator of each fraction by its building factor.  Step 3: We combine the resulting like fractions.  Step 4: The numerator of this fraction cannot be factored, so the sum cannot be reduced.  Practice 6 Write as a single fraction in reduced form:  If the denominators contain any common factors, the LCD is not simply their product. For example, the LCD for is not . It is true that 216 is a multiple of both 12 and 18, but it is not the smallest one! We can find a smaller common denominator by factoring each denominator. To find a number that both 12 and 18 divide into evenly, we need only enough factors to cover each of them. In this case two 2's and two 3's are sufficient, so the LCD is You can check that both 12 and 18 divide evenly into 36.  In general, we can find the LCD in the following way.  To Find the LCD lowest common denominator finding the   Factor each denominator completely.  Include each different factor in the LCD as many times as it occurs in any one of the given denominators.   Find the LCD for the fractions and   We factor the denominators of each of the given fractions. The factor occurs once in the first denominator, the factor occurs once in the second denominator, and the factor occurs once in each denominator. Therefore we include in our LCD one copy of each of these factors. The LCD is .   For more on finding the LCD, see Section 8.3.4 of the Toolkit.  In the previous Example, we do not include two factors of in the LCD. We need only one factor of , because occurs only once in each denominator. You can check that each original denominator divides evenly into our LCD, .  Practice 7 Find the LCD for the fractions and   Adding and Subtracting Unlike Fractions fraction adding or subtracting unlike fractions  After finding the LCD, we build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as its denominator. The new fractions will be like fractions, so we can combine their numerators.  Building a fraction is an application of the fundamental principle of fractions, It is the opposite of reducing a fraction, because we multiply, rather than divide, the numerator and denominator by an appropriate factor. To find the building factor building factor fraction building factor , we compare the factors of the original denominator with those of the desired common denominator.  Add:    Step 1: Find the LCD. We factor each denominator completely. The LCD is .  Step 2: We build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as its denominator. The building factor for is . We multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by : The building factor for is .  Step 3: The fractions are now like fractions, so we add them by combining their numerators.  Step 4: Finally, we reduce the fraction.   For more help with building, see Section 8.3.5 of the Toolkit.  Do not reduce the built-up fractions in Step 3 -- you will just get back to the original problem. When adding fractions, we have to make the fractions \"harder\" before we can combine them. Don't reduce until the last step of the problem.  QuickCheck 4 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   We can always find the LCD by multiplying together the denominators of the fractions.  If each denominator includes one factor of , we include two factors of in the LCD.  We find the building factor for each fraction by comparing its denominator to the LCD.  When adding fractions, it is best to reduce the fractions at each step.   Practice 8 Subtract:   Applications  Recall that the formulas for rational functions are algebraic fractions. It is often useful to simplify the formula for a function before using it.  When estimating their travel time, pilots must take into account the prevailing winds. A tail wind adds to the plane's ground speed, while a head wind decreases the ground speed. Skyhigh Airlines is setting up a shuttle service from Dallas to Phoenix, a distance of 800 miles.  Express the time needed for a one-way trip, without wind, as a function of the speed of the plane.  Suppose there is a prevailing wind of 30 miles per hour blowing from the west. Write expressions for the flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Dallas.  Write an expression for the round trip flying time with a 30-mile-per-hour wind from the west, as a function of the plane's speed. Simplify your expression.   Recall that . If we let represent the speed of the plane in still air, then the time required for a one-way trip is  On the trip from Dallas to Phoenix the plane encounters a head wind of 30 miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is . On the return trip the plan enjoys a tail wind of 30 miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is . Therefore, the flying times are  The round-trip flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and back is The LCD for these fractions is . Thus,  Practice 9 A rowing team can maintain a speed of 15 miles per hour in still water. The team's daily training session includes a 5-mile run up the Red Cedar River and the return downstream.   Express the team's time on the upstream leg as a function of the speed of the current.  Write a function for the team's time on the downstream leg.  Write and simplify an expression for the total time for the training run as a function of the current's speed.         Problem Set 8.3  Warm Up  In Problems 1 6, we review the operations on arithmetic fractions.                                              Skills Practice  Multiply.

Skyhigh Airlines is setting up a shuttle service from Dallas to Phoenix, a distance of 800 miles.  Express the time needed for a one-way trip, without wind, as a function of the speed of the plane.  Suppose there is a prevailing wind of 30 miles per hour blowing from the west. Write expressions for the flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Dallas.  Write an expression for the round trip flying time with a 30-mile-per-hour wind from the west, as a function of the plane's speed. Simplify your expression.   Recall that . If we let represent the speed of the plane in still air, then the time required for a one-way trip is  On the trip from Dallas to Phoenix the plane encounters a head wind of 30 miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is . On the return trip the plan enjoys a tail wind of 30 miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is .

  "body": "More Operations on Fractions  In this section we consider a few more skills for working with algebraic fractions.  Complex Fractions complex fraction fraction complex  A fraction that contains one or more fractions in either its numerator or its denominator or both is called a complex fraction complex fraction . For example, are complex fractions. Like simple fractions, complex fractions represent quotients. For the examples above, and We can always simplify a complex fraction into a standard algebraic fraction. One way to do this is to treat the fraction as a division.  Simplify  First, Write the complex fraction as a quotient. Invert the divisor and multiply.   Practice 1 Simplify  If the numerator or denominator of the complex fraction contains more than one term, there is an easier way to simplify the fraction. This method takes advantage of the fundamental principle of fractions.  Simplify  This complex fraction contains the simple fractions and . The LCD of these fractions is . We multiply the numerator and denominator of the complex fraction by . Doing this will not change the value of the fraction, but will clear all the \"smaller\" fractions inside. Then we apply the distributive law, so that we multiply each term of the numerator and each term of the denominator by . Finally, we reduce the result to obtain   We summarize the procedure for simplifying complex fractions as follows.  To simplify a complex fraction complex fraction simplify fraction complex fraction simplify simplifying a complex fraction   Find the LCD of all the fractions contained in the complex fraction.  Multiply the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction by the LCD.  Reduce the resulting simple fraction, if possible.   Practice 2 Simplify   Negative Exponents negative exponents  Algebraic fractions are sometimes written using negative exponents.  Write each expression as a single algebraic fraction.       We write each power as a fraction, then simplify.  We simplify the expression inside parentheses first. For the last step, remember that a negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of its base.   To review negative exponents, see Section 8.4.1 of the Toolkit.  When working with fractions and exponents, it is important to avoid some tempting but incorrect algebraic operations.  In part (a) of , note that For example, you can check that, for and ,  In part (b) of , note that The fourth law of exponents does not apply to sums and differences; that is,  Practice 3 Simplify  QuickCheck 1 Decide whether each statement is true or false.         Applications  Sometimes mathematics can help us solve problems when our intuition fails us or leads us astray.  On a weekday afternoon, when traffic is always horrible, Kathy left her home north of Los Angeles and drove south 120 miles along the San Diego Freeway to San Juan Capistrano. Her average speed was 40 miles per hour. She returned home on Saturday, at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. What was her average speed for the round trip?  If you said that the average speed is 50 miles per hour, you would be wrong! Let's do some calculations. Kathy's average speed for the round trip is given by The total distance she drove is 240 miles, but to find the total time we must compute the time Kathy drove on each part of the trip. We use the formula and solve for .         Driving south      Driving north      The total time for the round trip was hours, so Kathy's average speed was   Why does the average speed turn out to be less than 50 miles per hour? Because Kathy spent more time driving at 40 miles per hour (3 hours) than she did driving at 60 miles per hour (2 hours).  By generalizing the problem above we can find an algebraic formula for the average speed on a two-part trip. Suppose the distance traveled on the two parts of the trip are and , and the corresponding speeds on the two parts are and . We fill in the table to find the time required for each part.     Distance  Rate  Time   First part      Second part      The total distance traveled on the trip is , and the total time required is Thus, the average speed for the entire trip is  Practice 4 Bruce drove for 24 miles in rush-hour traffic at an average speed of 20 miles per hour. Then he drove 126 miles on the highway at an average speed of 70 miles an hour. Use the formula above to find his average speed for the entire trip. 50 mph   Polynomial Division polynomial division  Consider three improper fractions: and . Can these fractions be simplified?  We can reduce the first fraction:  The second fraction reduces to a whole number:  The third fraction does not reduce, but by dividing the denominator into the numerator, we can write it as a whole number plus a proper fraction:  An algebraic fraction is \"improper\" if the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. If it cannot be reduced, we can simplify the expression by treating it as a division of polynomials. The quotient will be the sum of a polynomial and a simpler algebraic fraction.  To review improper fractions, see Section 8.4.2 of the Toolkit.  If the divisor is a monomial, we can simply divide the monomial into each term of the numerator.  Divide  We divide into each term of the numerator. Note that the quotient is the sum of a polynomial, , and an algebraic fraction, .  Practice 5 Divide:  If the denominator is not a monomial, we use a method similar to the long division algorithm used in arithmetic.  Divide   We first write the quotient as a division problem: and divide (the first term of the numerator) by (the first term of the denominator) to obtain . (It may be helpful to write down the division: .) We write above the quotient bar as the first term of the quotient, as shown below.  Next, we multiply by to obtain , and subtract this product from : Repeating the process, we divide by to obtain . We write as the second term of the quotient. Then we multiply by to obtain , and subtract: Because the degree of the remainder, 8, is less than the degree of , the division is finished. The quotient is , with a remainder of . We write the remainder as a fraction to obtain   To check a polynomial division, see Section 8.4.3 of the Toolkit.  When using polynomial division, it helps to write the polynomials in descending powers of the variable. If the numerator is missing any terms, we can insert terms with zero coefficients so that like powers will be aligned. For example, to perform the division we first write the numerator in descending powers as . We insert between and and set up the quotient as We then proceed as in . You can check that the quotient is  Practice 6 Divide:  QuickCheck 2 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   The shortcut for simplifying complex fractions applies the fundamental principle of fractions.  An improper algebraic fraction is one in which the denominator has higher degree than the numerator.  If the remainder is zero in polynomial division , the numerator can be factored.  If the divisor in polynomial division is a binomial, we use a process like long division.     Problem Set 8.4  Warm Up   Add  Subtract  Multiply  Divide    Skills Practice  For Problems 5 16, simplify the complex fraction.               For Problems 17 20, divide. Write your answer as the sum of a polynomial and an algebraic fraction.       For Problems 21 24, use polynomial division to write the quotient as the sum of a polynomial and an algebraic fraction.        Applications    On the figure at right, locate the points , , , and . Connect the points with line segments in the order to form a four-sided figure.   rectangle in first quadrant, one corner at origin   Compute the slopes of each side of the figure. and ; and   Suppose and are two positive numbers. Write an expression for their average, and then for the reciprocal of their average.  For the same numbers and , write an expression for the average of their reciprocals.  Are your expressions in parts (a) and (b) the same? Choose values for and and evaluate both expressions.  The focal length of a lens is given by the formula where stands for the focal length, is the distance from the object viewed to the lens, and is the distance from the image to the lens. Suppose you estimate that the distance from your cat (the object viewed) to your camera lens is 60 inches greater than the distance from the lens to the film inside the camera, where the image forms.

  "body": "Equations with Fractions equation with fractions    graph of rational function for solving equation  In of Section 8.2 Francine planned a 60-mile training run on her cycle-plane. The time required for the training run, in terms of the windspeed, , is given by: If it takes Francine 9 hours to cover 60 miles, what is the speed of the wind? We can answer this question by reading values from the graph of , as shown at left. When , the value of is between 8 and 9, so the windspeed is between 8 and 9 miles per hour.   Solving Algebraically  If we need a more accurate value for the windspeed, we can solve the equation To start, we multiply each side of the equation by the denominator of the fraction. This will clear the fraction and give us an equivalent equation without fractions.  Solve the equation  We multiply both sides of the equation by to obtain From here we can proceed as usual. The windspeed was , or miles per hour.  Practice 1 Solve  If the equation contains more than one fraction, we can clear all the denominators at once by multiplying both sides by the LCD of the fractions. lowest common denominator clearing fractions with  Solve  The LCD for the two fractions in the equation is . We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD. We proceed as usual to complete the solution. First we use the distributive law to remove parentheses. The solution is .  We must multiply each term of an equation by the LCD, whether or not the term is a fraction. In the previous Example we multiplied each term by the LCD, including the 8.  Practice 2 Solve The solutions are and .   Proportions proportion  A proportion  proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. For example, To solve this proportion, we can multiply both sides by the LCD, 30, to get  There is a short-cut we can use that avoids calculating an LCD. Observe that we can arrive at the equation by cross-multiplying cross-multiplying proportion proportion cross-multiplying :  cross-multiplying  We then proceed as before to complete the solution.  The cross-multiplying shortcut is a fundamental property of proportions.  Property of Proportions property of proportions proportion cross-multiplying    The scale on a map of Fairfield County says that centimeter represents a distance of 10 kilometers. If Eastlake and Kenwood are 6 centimeters apart on the map, what is the distance between the two towns?  The ratio of the two actual distances is the same as the ratio of the corresponding distances on the map. We let stand for the distance between Eastlake and Kenwood, and write a proportion.  We must be careful to keep the same order in both ratios. We choose to put the distance between towns in the numerators, and the distances on the scale in the denominator. To solve the propotion, we cross-multiply. The two towns are 80 kilometers apart.  Practice 3 On a scale model of Fantasy Valley, inches represents 50 yards. If the distance from the water slide to the bungee jump is 20 inches on the model, what is the distance between the two rides? The distance between the two rides is yards.  Do not try to use \"cross-multiplying\" on equations that are not proportions, or on any other operations involving fractions. The shortcut works only on proportions.  QuickCheck 1 Fill in the blanks to complete each statement.  To clear fractions from an equation, we multiply each term by the of all the fractions.  True or False: When clearing fraction from an equation, we do not multiply terms that are not fractions.  A proportion is a statement that two are equal.  Cross-multiplying works only on .    Extraneous Solutions  Recall that an algebraic fraction is undefined for any values of that make its denominator equal zero. These values cannot be solutions to equations involving the fraction. Consider the equation When we multiply both sides by the LCD, , we obtain whose solution is . However, is not a solution of the original equation. Both sides of the equation are undefined at . If you graph the two functions you will find that the graphs never intersect, which means that there is no solution to the original equation.  What went wrong with our method of solution? We multiplied both sides of the equation by , which is zero when , so we really multiplied both sides of the equation by zero. Multiplying by zero does not produce an equivalent equation, and false solutions may be introduced.  An apparent solution that does not satisfy the original equation is called an extraneous solution extraneous solution . Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solution obtained does not cause any of the fractions to be undefined.  Solve the equation .  We multiply both sides by the LCD, . Notice that we multiply each term on the left side by the LCD, to get or We use the distributive law to remove the parentheses and write the result in standard form: This is a quadratic equation that we can solve by factoring.  so the solutions are and . Neither of these values causes either denominator to equal zero, so they are not extraneous solutions.  To review solving quadratic equations, see Section 8.5.1 of the Toolkit.  The following \"solution\" for the previous Example is incorrect. Do you see why?  QuickCheck 2 Fill in the blanks to complete each statement.  An algebraic fraction is undefined when .  An apparent solution that does not satisfy the original equation is called solution.  We may introduce extraneous solutions if we multiply both sides of an equation by .  We must multiply each of the equation by the LCD.   Practice 4 Solve   Solving Graphically  We can use graphs to solve an equation, as we see in the following Example.  Solve the equation graphically:   We graph the two functions in the window as shown in figure (a).  GC images of intersecting rational functions  It appears that the two graphs may intersect in the third quadrant, around . To investigate further, we change the window settings to and obtain the close-up view shown in figure (b). In this window, we can see that the graphs intersect in two distinct points, and by using the Trace we find that their -coordinates are and .  To review solving equations graphically, see Section 8.5.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 5 The manager of a new health club kept track of the number of active members over the club's first few months of operation.

Verify your answer algebraically by solving an equation.   graph  In months 1 and 4    Applications  Application problems may lead to equations with algebraic fractions.  Rani times herself as she kayaks 30 miles down the Derwent River with the help of the current. Returning upstream against the current, she manages only 18 miles in the same amount of time. Rani knows that she can kayak at a rate of 12 miles per hour in still water. What is the speed of the current?  If we let represent the speed of the current, we can use the formula to fill in the following table.     Distance  Rate  Time   Downstream      Upstream      Because Rani paddled for equal amounts of time upstream and downstream, we have the equation The LCD for the fractions in this equation is . We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to obtain Solving this equation, we find The speed of the current is 3 miles per hour.  We can solve the equation in graphically by considering two functions, one for each side of the equation. Graph the two functions in the window to obtain the graph shown below.  intersecting rational functions  The function gives the time it takes Rani to paddle 30 miles downstream, and gives the time it takes her to paddle 18 miles upstream. Both of these times depend on the speed of the current, .  We are looking for a value of that makes and equal. This occurs at the intersection point of the two graphs, . Thus, the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour, as we found in . The y-coordinate of the intersection point gives the time Rani paddled on each part of her trip: 2 hours each way.  Practice 6 A cruise boat travels 18 miles downstream and back in hours. If the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour, what is the speed of the boat in still water?   Let represent the speed of the boat in still water, and fill in the table.     Distance  Rate  Time   Downstream      Upstream      Write an equation to model the problem:   Solve your equation, and answer the question in the problem.      Distance  Rate  Time   Downstream      Upstream       In still water the boat travels at 9 mph.    Formulas  Algebraic fractions may appear in formulas that relate several variables. If we want to solve for one variable in terms of the others, we may need to clear the fractions.  Solve the formula for .  Because the variable we want appears in the denominator, we must first multiply both sides of the equation by that denominator, . We apply the distributive law on the left side, then collect all terms that involve on one side of the equation. We cannot combine the two terms containing because they are not like terms. However, we can factor out , so that the right side is written as a single term containing the variable . We can then complete the solution.   Practice 7 Solve for :   QuickCheck 3 Decide whether each statement is true or false.  To solve an equation graphically, we graph two functions, (each side of the equation.)  The solutions are the -coordinates of the intersection points of the two graphs.  To solve a formula that is linear in the desired variable, we must get all terms including that variable on one side of the equation.  If two or more terms on one side of the equation include the desired variable, we factor it out.    Summary  In this chapter we have learned a number of algebraic skills to deal with fractions. Here are the operations we studied:  reducing fractions  multiplying and dividing fractions  adding and subtracting fractions  simplifying complex fractions  polynomial division  solving equations with fractions   Each type of operation has a particular method, and it may help to review which method to use on each type of operation.

The coefficient of the highest power term is called the lead coefficient lead coefficient .  Degree of a Product  The degree of a product of non-zero polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the factors. That is:  If has degree and has degree , then their product has degree .  Special Products of Binomials   Cube of a Binomial     Factoring the Sum or Difference of Two Cubes      Fundamental Principle of Fractions  We can multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero factor, and the new fraction will be equivalent to the old one.  When we cancel common factors, we are dividing . Because division is the inverse or opposite operation for multiplication, we can cancel common factors , but we cannot cancel common terms .  To reduce an algebraic fraction   Factor the numerator and the denominator.  Divide the numerator and denominator by any common factors.  Rational Function  A rational function has the form where and are polynomials. A rational function is undefined at any -values where .  Operations on Fractions  If , then  If , then  If , then   To multiply algebraic fractions:   Factor each numerator and denominator.  If any factor appears in both a numerator and a denominator, divide out that factor.  Multiply the remaining factors of the numerator and the remaining factors of the denominator.  Reduce the product if necessary.  To divide algebraic fractions:   Take the reciprocal of the second fraction and change the operation to multiplication.  Follow the rules for multiplication of fractions.  To add or subtract algebraic fractions   Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.  Build each fraction to an equivalent one with the same denominator.  Add or subtract the resulting like fractions: Add or subtract their numerators, and keep the same denominator.  Reduce the sum or difference if necessary.  To Find the LCD   Factor each denominator completely.  Include each different factor in the LCD as many times as it occurs in any one of the given denominators.  To simplify a complex fraction   Find the LCD of all the fractions contained in the complex fraction.  Multiply the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction by the LCD.  Reduce the resulting simple fraction, if possible.  An algebraic fractrion is \"improper\" if the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. If it cannot be reduced, we can simplify the expression by treating it as a division of polynomials. The quotient will be the sum of a polynomial and a simpler algebraic fraction.  If an equation contains more than one fraction, we can clear all the denominators at once by multiplying both sides by the LCD of the fractions.  Property of Proportions    Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solution obtained does not cause any of the fractions to be undefined.     Chapter 8 Review Problems  For Problems 1 and 2, multiply.     For Problems 3 and 4, factor.

  "body": "Properties of Lines  So far we have used linear equations to model variables that increase or decrease at a constant rate, and, of course, their graphs are straight lines. In this chapter we'll study the connections between some basic geometric shapes and their algebraic equations, starting with straight lines.  Horizontal and Vertical Lines  In Section 1.5 we learned that the general form for a linear equation is What happens if ? For example, what does the graph of look like? This equation tells us that every point on the line must have -coordinate 3, but it puts no restrictions on the -coordinates. For example, are all solutions of the equation. These points lie on a horizontal line, as shown below left.   horizontal line  vertical line  On the other hand, if , we have an equation such as This equation tells us that any point with -coordinate lies on the graph. For example, and are solutions. All the solutions lie on the vertical line shown above right.  Note that the horizontal line has -intercept y -intercept  but no -intercept, and the vertical line has -intercept x -intercept  but no -intercept.  Horizontal and Vertical Lines horizontal line vertical line   The equation of the horizontal line horizontal line passing through is  The equation of the vertical line vertical line line vertical passing through is   Give the equation of each line.  horizontal line  horizontal line    This is a horizontal line with -intercept , so its equation is .  This is a vertical line with -intercept , so its equation is .   Now let's compute the slopes of the two lines in the previous Example .  To review computing slope, see Section 9.1.1 of the Toolkit. We choose two points on the graph of , say and , and use these points to compute the slope. The slope of the horizontal line is zero. In fact, the slope of any horizontal line is zero, because the -coordinates of all the points on the line are equal. Thus, for any horizontal line  On a vertical line, the -coordinates of all the points are equal. For example, two points on the line are and . Using these points to compute the slope, we find which is undefined. The slope of any vertical line is undefined because the expression equals zero.  Slopes of Horizontal and Vertical Lines horizontal line slope of vertical line slope of slope undefined slope zero  The slope of a horizontal line horizontal line is zero .  The slope of a vertical line vertical line is undefined .   Practice 1  What is the slope of any line parallel to the -axis?  What is the slope of any line parallel to the -axis?   0  undefined   QuickCheck 1 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   A horizontal line has no slope.  The equation of a vertical line is undefined.  A vertical line is not the graph of a function.  The graph of is a point.    Parallel and Perpendicular Lines   Lines that lie in the same plane but never intersect are called parallel parallel lines line parallel lines. They have the same \"steepness\" or inclination, so it is easy to understand that parallel lines have the same slope. You can verify that the parallel lines in the figure at right both have slope  parallel lines   perpendicular lines  Perpendicular perpendicular lines line perpendicular lines in a plane meet at right angles, or 90°. The relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines is not so easy to see as the relationship for parallel lines. However, for the perpendicular lines shown at left, you can verify that  Note that the product of and is , that is, This relationship holds for any pair of perpendicular lines. We summarize these results as follows.  Parallel and Perpendicular Lines   Two lines are parallel parallel lines line parallel if their slopes are equal, that is, if or if both lines are vertical.  Two lines are perpendicular perpendicular lines line perpendicular if the product of their slopes is , that is, if or if one of the lines is horizontal and one is vertical.   Another way to state the condition for perpendicular lines is Because of this relationship, we often say that the slope of one perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal negative reciprocal of the other.  Decide whether the lines are parallel, perpendicular, or neither.  We could graph the lines, but we can't be sure from a graph if the lines are exactly parallel or exactly perpendicular. A more accurate way to settle the question is to find the slope of each line. To do this we write each equation in slope-intercept form; that is, we solve for . The slope of the first line is , and the slope of the second line is . The slopes are not equal, so the lines are not parallel. However, the product of the slopes is so the lines are perpendicular.  Practice 2  What is the slope of a line that is parallel to ?  What is the slope of a line that is perpendicular to ?      QuickCheck 2 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   The best way to test whether two lines are perpendicular is to graph them.  Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are reciprocals.  If two lines are not parallel, they must be perpendicular.  A vertical line is perpendicular to a horizontal line.    Applications to Geometry  These relationships for the slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines can help us solve numerous geometric problems.  Show that the triangle with vertices , , and is a right triangle.  We will show that two of the sides of the right triangle are perpendicular. The line segment has slope   and the segment has slope Because  triangle  The sides and perpendicular, and therefore the triangle is a right triangle.   For more examples of geometric problems, see Section 9.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3 Show that the quadrilateral with vertices , , , and is a parallelogram.  (Hint: Show that is parallel to , and that is parallel to .) ;  Find an equation for the line that passes through the point and is perpendicular to the line .   First we find the slope of the desired line, then use the point-slope formula to write its equation. The line we want is perpendicular to the given line, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of , the slope of the given line. Thus  line perpendicular to given line  Now we use the point-slope formula with and . The given line and the perpendicular line are shown in the figure above.  To review the point-slope formula, see Section 9.1.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4  Follow the steps to find an equation for the altitude of the triangle shown at right. (Recall that the altitude of a triangle is perpendicular to its base.)  Find the slope of the base.   Find the slope of the altitude.   altitude of triangle  Use the point-slope formula.

  "body": " From straight lines we can build triangles and other polygons. For curves, the simplest figure is a circle, so we'll consider circles next. You know that a circle is the set of all points in a plane at the same distance from the the center of the circle, so our first task will be to develop a formula for the distance between two points.  The Distance and Midpoint Formulas  Distance in a Coordinate Plane  Figure (a) shows a line segment joining the two points and . What is the distance between the two points?   line segment in coordinate plane   line segment as hypotenuse  Definition  The distance between two points is the length of the segment joining them.   If we make a right triangle as shown in Figure (b), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find its length. First, notice that the coordinates at the right angle are . We can find the lengths of the two legs of the triangle, because they are horizontal and vertical segments. The segment we want is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, so we apply the Pythagorean theorem.   The Distance Formula  We can also use the Pythagorean theorem to derive a formula for the distance between any two points, and , in terms of their coordinates. We first label a right triangle, as we did in the discussion above. Draw a horizontal line through and a vertical line through .  These lines meet at a point , as shown in the figure below. The -coordinate of is the same as the -coordinate of , and the -coordinate of is the same as the -coordinate of . Thus, the coordinates of are .  distance between two points in the plane  The distance between and is , and the distance between and is . These two numbers are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle. The length of the hypotenuse is the distance between and , which we'll call . By the Pythagorean theorem, Taking the (positive) square root of each side of this equation gives us the distance formula distance formula .  Distance Formula distance formula  The distance  between points and is   QuickCheck 1 Decide whether each statement is true or false.   The distance formula is a version of the Pythagorean theorem.    We can find the length of a horizontal segment by subtracting the -coordinates of its endpoints.  The distance between two points is always a positive number (or zero).   Find the distance between and .  Substitute for and for in the distance formula to obtain  To review working with radicals, see Section 9.2.1 of the Toolkit.  It doesn't matter which point we call and which is . We obtain the same answer in the previous Example if we switch the two points and use for and for :  We cannot simplify as . Remember that . You can easily see this by observing that so it cannot be true that equals , or 7. For the same reason, we cannot simplify the distance formula to .  Practice 1  Find the distance between the points and .  Plot the points, and illustrate how the Pythagorean theorem is used in calculating the distance.    distance formula    The Midpoint Formula  The midpoint midpoint of a segment is the point halfway between its endpoints, so that the distance from the midpoint to either endpoint is the same.  The -coordinate of the midpoint is halfway between the -coordinates of the endpoints, and likewise for the -coordinate. For the points and shown below, the -coordinate of the midpoint is , which is halfway between and . The -coordinate is halfway between and , or . Thus, the midpoint is .  line segment  If we know the coordinates of two points, we can calculate the coordinates of the midpoint. Each coordinate of the midpoint is the average of the corresponding coordinates of the two points.  Midpoint Formula  The midpoint midpoint of the line segment joining the points and is the point , where   QuickCheck 2 Fill in the blanks to complete the statements.  Each coordinate of the midpoint is the of the corresponding coordinates of the endpoints.  The midpoint of a segment is the same from each endpoint of the segment.   Find the midpoint of the line segment joining the points and .  We substitute for and for in the midpoint formula to obtain The midpoint of the segment is the point .  Practice 2  Find the midpoint of the line joining the points and  Plot the points and draw a rectangle with the points as opposite vertices. Illustrate that the midpoint is the center of the rectangle.    rectangle    Circles  A circle circle is the set of all points in a plane that lie at a given distance, called the radius radius , from a fixed point called the center center of a circle circle center . We can use the distance formula to find an equation for a circle. First consider the circle in Figure (a), whose center is the origin, .  circles  The distance from the origin to any point on the circle is . Therefore, or, squaring both sides, Thus, the equation for a circle of radius centered at the origin is  Now consider the circle in Figure (b), whose center is the point . Every point on the circle lies a distance from , so the equation of the circle is given by the following formula.  Standard Form for a Circle circle equation of circle radius circle center radius radius circle  The equation for a circle of radius centered at the point is   Find a point with -coordinate that lies on the circle .   We substitute into the equation, and solve for . We see that the solutions are and . Thus, the points and lie on the circle.  For more examples using the equation of a circle, see Section 9.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3 Does lie on the circle ? Yes  QuickCheck 3 Answer each question below.  Does the center of a circle lie on the graph of the circle?  What is the radius of the circle ?  What is the diameter of the circle in part (b)?  Can we simplify the equation in part (b) to ?   It is easy to graph a circle if its equation is given in standard form.  Graph the circles.      The graph of is a circle with radius 4 and center at . To sketch the graph, we first locate the center of the circle. (The center is not part of the graph of the circle.)  From the center, we move a distance of 4 units (the radius of the circle) in each of four directions: up, down, left, and right. This locates four points that lie on the circle: , , , and . We sketch the circle through these four points.  circles  The graph of is a circle with radius and center at . From the center, we move approximately , or 2.6 units in each of the four coordinate directions to obtain the points , , , and . We sketch the circle through these four points.

We use the distance formula with the points and to find the radius. Finally, we substitute 4 for and 2 for (the coordinates of the center) and for (the radius) into the standard form to obtain  Practice 5 Find an equation for the circle whose diameter has endpoint and .   General Form for Circles  The equations of circles often appear in a general quadratic form general quadratic form of a circle circle general quadratic form , rather than the standard form described above. For example, we can expand the squares of binomials in part (a) of the previous Example, to obtain or  This is a quadratic equation in two variables. Such an equation describes a circle if the coefficients of the quadratic, or squared, terms are equal.  Conversely, an equation of the form can be converted to standard form by completing the square completing the square in both variables. Once this is done, the center and radius of the circle can be determined directly from the equation.  Write the equation of the circle in standard form, and graph the equation.  We prepare to complete the square in both variables by writing the equation as We complete the square in by adding 16 to each side of the equation, and complete the square in by adding 1 to each side, to get   from which we obtain the standard form, Thus, the circle has its center at , and its radius is , or approximately 3.3. The graph is shown at right.  circle   To review completing the square, see Section 9.2.3 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 4 Fill in the blanks.  The standard form for a circle is useful because we can see the of the circle in the equation.  A quadratic equation in two variables describes a circle if the coefficients of the quadratic terms are .  We convert the equation for a circle into standard form by in both variables.   Practice 6 Write the equation of the circle in standard form.   Investigation  Global Positioning  The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used by hikers, pilots, surveyors, automobiles to determine their location (latitude, longitude, and elevation) anywhere on the surface of the earth. The system depends on a collection of satellites in orbit around the earth. Each GPS satellite transmits its own position and the current time at regular intervals.  A person with a GPS receiver on earth can calculate his or her distance from the satellite by comparing the time of transmission with the time when it receives the signal. Of course, there are many points at the same distance from the satellite—in fact, the set of all points at a certain distance from the satellite lie on a sphere centered at the satellite. That is why there are several satellites: You calculate your position by finding the intersection point of several such spheres centered on different satellites.  We will consider a simplified, two-dimensional model of a GPS system in which the satellites and the receiver all lie in the -plane instead of in three-dimensional space.  In this model we’ll need data from two GPS satellites. The satellites are orbiting along a circle of radius 100 meters centered at the origin. You have a receiver inside that circle and would like to know the coordinates of your position within the circle.  grid  To make the computations simpler, we will also assume that the satellite transmissions travel at 5 meters per second.   A signal from Satellite A arrives 18 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite A?  The signal says that Satellite A was located at at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite A.   Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (2).  A signal from Satellite B arrives 8.4 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite B?  The signal says that Satellite B was located at at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite B.  Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (5).  Your position must lie at the intersection point, , of your two graphs. Estimate the coordinates of your position from the graph. (Remember that you are within the orbits of the satellites.)  Later in this chapter you will learn how to find the coordinates of algebraically by solving a system of equations. Verify that the ordered pairs and both satisfy the equations you wrote in part (3) and part (6). What are the coordinates of ?

  "body": "Conic Sections: Ellipses  The graph of any first-degree equation in two variables, is a line (as long as and are not both 0). A second-degree equation in two variables has the general form where , , and cannot all be zero (because in that case the equation would not be second degree). The graphs of such equations are curves called conic sections conic section because they are formed by the intersection of a plane and a cone, as illustrated below. Except for a few special cases called degenerate conics degenerate conic , the conic sections fall into four categories called circles circle , ellipses ellipse , hyperbolas hyperbola , and parabolas parabola .  conics  Conic sections whose centers (or vertices, in the case of parabolas) are located at the origin are called central conics central conic .   Circles and Ellipses  The circle is the most familiar of the conic sections. Recall that the standard equation for a circle of radius, , centered at the point is: and a circle whose center is the origin has equation If we divide through by , we can also write this equation in the form Notice that the denominators of both the - and -terms are . You can check that the - and -intercepts of this circle are and .  If the denominators of the -squared and -squared terms are not equal, the graph is called an ellipse ellipse . An ellipse is an elongated circle, or oval. Ellipses appear in a variety of applications. The orbits of the planets and of satellites about the earth are ellipses. The arches in some bridges are elliptical in shape, and whispering domes, such as the ceiling of the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, are made from ellipses.  A circle is defined as the set of all points in a plane that lie at a fixed distance from its center. An ellipse also has a geometric definition.  Ellipse ellipse  An ellipse ellipse is the set of points in the plane, the sum of whose distances from two fixed points (the foci ellipse foci focus of an ellipse ) is a constant.   Using the distance formula and the definition above, we can show that the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin has the following standard form.  Central Ellipse ellipse central ellipse ellipse central center of an ellipse  The equation of an ellipse centered at the origin is   By setting equal to zero in the equation above, we find that the -intercepts of this ellipse are and ; by setting equal to zero, we find that the -intercepts are and .  The line segment that passes through the foci (labeled and on the graphs below) and ends on the ellipse is called the major axis axis major ellipse major axis major axis ellipse . If , the major axis is horizontal, as shown in the Figure below left. The -intercepts are the endpoints of the major axis, so its length is .

Hyperbolas occur in a number of applied settings. The navigational system called LORAN (long-range navigation) uses radio signals to locate a ship or plane at the intersection of two hyperbolas. Satellites moving with sufficient speed will follow an orbit that is branch of a hyperbola; for example, a rocket sent to the moon must be fitted with retrorockets to reduce its speed in order to achieve an elliptical, rather than hyperbolic, orbit about the moon.

The asymptotes pass through the vertices of the hyperbola.  We find the center of the hyperbola by completing the square.    General Quadratic Equation in Two Variables  We have considered graphs of second-degree equations in two variables, for which , the coefficient of the -term, is zero. These graphs are conic sections with axes parallel to one or both of the coordinate axes. If does not equal zero, the axes of the conic section are rotated with respect to the coordinate axes. The graphing of such equations is taken up in more advanced courses in analytic geometry.  The graph of a second-degree equation can also be a point, a line, a pair of lines, or no graph at all, depending on the values of the coefficients through . Such graphs are called degenerate conics degenerate conic conic section degenerate .  Given an equation of the form we can determine the nature of the graph from the coefficients of the quadratic terms. If the graph is not a degenerate conic, the following criteria apply.  Conic Sections conic section  The graph of is  a circle if .  a parabola if or (but not both).  an ellipse if and have the same sign.  a hyperbola if and have opposite signs.   Name the graph of each equation, assuming that the graph is not degenerate.       The graph is a circle because the coefficients of and are equal.  The graph is an ellipse because the coefficients of and are both positive.  The graph is a hyperbola because the coefficients of and have opposite signs.  The graph is a parabola because is of first degree and is of second degree.   The standard forms for the conic sections conic section standard form are summarized in the table below. For the parabola, is the vertex of the graph, and for the other conics, is the center. circle ellipse hyperbola parabola  table of conic sections   The coefficients , , and do not figure in determining the type of conic section the equation represents. They do, however, determine the position of the graph relative to the origin. Once we recognize the form of the graph, we can write the equation in standard form in order to discover more information about the graph.

  "body": "Nonlinear Systems  Systems Involving Quadratic Equations  Recall that the solution to a system of linear equations is the intersection point of the graphs of the equations. This is also true of systems in which one or both of the equations is quadratic. The figure below shows the three cases for systems of one quadratic and one linear equation.  graphs of 3 cases for quadratic system  In the next Example, we use both graphical and algebraic techniques to solve the system.  For more examples of problems that can be solved with a system of equations, see Section 9.5.1 of the Toolkit.  The Pizza Connection calculates that the cost, in dollars, of producing pizzas per day is given by The Pizza Connection charges $15 per pizza, so the revenue from selling pizzas is How many pizzas per day must the Pizza Connection sell in order to break even?  To break even means to make zero profit. Because the break-even points occur when revenue equals cost. In mathematical terms, we would like to find any values of for which . If we graph the revenue and cost functions on the same axes, these values correspond to points where the two graphs intersect. Use the WINDOW settings on your calculator to obtain the graph shown below. You can verify that the two intersection points are and .  GC figure for quadratic system  Thus, the Pizza Connection must sell either 15 or 80 pizzas in order to break even. On the graph we see that revenue is greater than cost for -values between 15 and 80, so the Pizza Connection will make a profit if it sells between 15 and 80 pizzas.  We can also solve algebraically for the break-even points. The intersection points of the two graphs correspond to the solutions of the system of equations We equate the two expressions for and solve for :  The solutions are 15 and 80, as we found from the graph.  Practice 1  Solve the system algebraically:  Graph both equations, and show the solutions on the graph.    parabola and line   What about a system of two quadratic equations ? You can sketch some possible systems to convince yourself that two such graphs can intersect in one point, two points, or no points at all.  Solve the system  We graph these two equations in the standard window and use the intersect feature to locate one of the solutions, as shown in the figure.   You can check that the point is an exact solution to the system by substituting and into each equation of the system. We find the other solution by moving the bug close to the other intersection point and using the intersect feature again. You can verify that the other solution is the point  GC graph showing quadratic system   To solve the system algebraically, we equate the two expressions for . After expanding the left side and collecting like terms, we arrive at a quadratic equation, which we can solve with the quadratic formula, and find two values for , namely and . To find the -value for each of these intersection points, we substitute the -coordinate into either of the two original equations.

Systems involving other conics may have up to four solutions.  Find the intersection points of the graphs of   We will use substitution to solve the system. We solve the easier of the two equations (the second equation) for to obtain . Then we substitute for in the first equation to find  circle and hyperbola  This equation has only one variable, , and we solve it by first clearing fractions. We multiply both sides by , and then subtract to obtain Finally, substitute each of these values into to find the -components of each solution.

If both equations are of the form elimination of variables is more efficient.  Find the solutions to the following system of equations. Verify the solutions on a graph.   We multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 60 to obtain Adding these two equations, we have  GC ellipse and hyperbola   so . We substitute these values for into either equation and solve for to find the solutions , , and .  The two original equations describe a hyperbola and an ellipse. We can obtain graphs on the calculator by solving each equation for to get Using the window , we obtain the graph shown above. The solutions of the system are the intersection points of the graphs.  For more examples of using elimination, see Section 9.5.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 4 Find the intersection points of the graphs of  , , ,   For some quadratic systems, we use a combination of elimination of variable sand substitution.  Find the intersection of the circles given by the equations.    We subtract the second equation from the first equation to obtain Solving for , we have  two circles  Next, we substitute for into either of the original equations.

  "body": "Logarithmic Functions  In this section we study logarithmic functions logarithmic function . For example, is a logarithmic function. In order to understand logarithmic functions better, we first investigate how they are related to more familiar functions, the exponential functions.  Inverse of a Function  You know that raising to the th power and taking th roots are inverse operations . For example, if we first cube a number and then take its cube root, we return to the original number. Now consider the functions that describe those operations: The graphs of and are related in an interesting way, as shown below.  cube root and cube funcions  If we place a mirror along the line , each graph is the reflection of the other. We say that the graphs are \"symmetric about the line .\"  The two functions and are called inverse functions . Look at the tables of values for the two functions.                                         By interchanging the rows in the table for , we get the table for . This makes sense when we recall that each function undoes the effect of the other. In fact, we define the cube root function by  In other words, if we interchange the variables in the cubing function, , to get , we have an equivalent formula for the cube root function, .  Quickcheck 1 Simplify each expression without a calculator.        Inverse of an Exponential Function  A similar rule relates the operations of raising a base to a power and taking a base logarithm. So the function is the inverse function for . Each function undoes the effect of the other. For example, let and . Start with , apply , and then apply to the result. We return to the original number, 3.  We can write these operations in one expression as (Remember the order of operations: do what's inside of parentheses first.) Because the log and the exponential are inverse functions, this identity holds for any value of and any base . That is We can also apply the two functions in the opposite order, so that (This one is harder to see, but we compute the exponent, , first.) And in general  and is its inverse function.   What is ?  Evaluate and simplify  Evaluate and simplify        To see more examples using function notation, see Section 10.1.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Simplify each expression.             Graphs of Logarithmic Functions  What does the graph of a log function look like? We can use exponential functions to help us.  Graph  We can make a table of values for by interchanging the columns in a table for .                                                 We plot the points for each function, connecting them with smooth curves, as shown below. You can see that the two graphs are symmetric about the line .  2 to x and log base 2   For another example of a logarithmic function, see Section 10.1.1 of the Toolkit.  The same technique works for graphing a log function with any base.  Practice 2 Graph the function and its inverse function on the same axes. 10 to x and common log  QuickCheck 2 Using a calculator, how could you estimate the value of ?   Find multiples of 5.  Find the fifth root of 378.  Find powers of 5.  Divide 378 by 5.   Did you notice that the graphs of the log functions do not have any points with negative -coordinates? This is because an exponential function has no negative (or zero) output values, so a log function has no negative or zero input values. In other words,   In addition, the logarithmic function has the following properties.  Properties of Log Functions  For any base :  The logarithmic function is defined for positive only.

Calculate the doubling time of the following tumor: its diameter when first detected was 1 cm, and 7 days later its diameter was 1.05 cm. 33 days  Logarithmic functions are useful for modeling increasing functions increasing function that slow down as the input increases.  In 1900, the average life expectancy at birth in the U.S. was 47.3 years. Since then, life expectancy has increased according to the formula where is the number of years after 1900.  Graph the life expectancy function for the years 1900 to 2010.  The life expectancy in 1950 was 68.2 years. What does the function predict for life expectancy in 1950?  How much did life expectancy increase between 1920 and 1930? How much did it increase between 1990 and 2000?    We can make a table of values and plot points to obtain the graph below.                    average life expectancy  We substitute into the function to find The function predicts a life expectancy of 67.7 years in 1950.  Between 1920 and 1930, life expectancy increased from 56.2 to 61.2, or 5 years. Between 1990 and 2000 it increased from 75.0 to 76.4, or 1.4 years.   In the previous Example, we see that although life expectancy has been increasing over time, it has been slowing down or leveling off. It remains to be seen whether the model continues to predict life expectancy after the year 2000.

We use the conversion equations to write the equation in exponential form. The solution is 36.  Practice 6 Solve  Remember that we cannot take a logarithm of a negative number or zero, because the output of an exponential function is always positive.  For example, suppose that . Then . But this is impossible, because cannot be negative. Thus, the log of a negative number (or zero) is undefined.  Because of this fact, extraneous solutions can arise when we solve logarithmic equations. extraneous solution  If the equation contains more than one log, we must first combine any expressions involving logs into a single logarithm.  Solve .  We use Property (1) of logarithms (see Properties of Logarithms ) to rewrite the left-hand side as a single logarithm: Once the left-hand side is expressed as a single logarithm, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form as Simplifying the right side gives us a quadratic equation to solve. We find or . But we must check the original equation for extraneous solutions. The number is not a solution of the original equation, because neither nor is defined for . The apparent solution is extraneous, and the solution of the original equation is .  to review using the properties of logs, see Section 10.1.3 of the Toolkit.

On average, the subjects had forgotten 20% of the words. The researchers found that the more lists their volunteers memorized, the larger the fraction of words they were unable to recall. (Source: Underwood, Scientific American , vol. 210, no. 3)    Number of lists,         Percent forgotten,          Plot the data. What sort of function seems to fit the data points?

The water velocity at any point in a stream or river is related to the logarithm of the depth at that point. For the Hoback River near Bondurant, Wyoming, where is the velocity of the water, in feet per second, and is the vertical distance from the stream bed, in feet, at that point. For Pole Creek near Pinedale, Wyoming, Both streams are feet deep at the locations mentioned. (Source: Leopold, Luna, Wolman, and Gordon, 1992)  Complete the table of values for each stream.    Distance from bed (feet)         Velocity, Hoback River, (ft\/sec)         Velocity, Pole Creek (ft\/sec)         If you double the distance from the bed, by how much does the velocity increase in each stream?  Plot both functions on the same graph.  The average velocity of the entire stream can be closely approximated as follows: Measure the velocity at 20% of the total depth of the stream from the surface and at 80% of the total depth, then average these two values. Find the average velocity for the Hoback River and for Pole Creek.   In of this section, we considered a formula for the average life expectancy in the U.S. as a function of years after 1900, According to the formula, in what year was the life expectancy 70 years? 1962  In Practice 5 of this section, we considerd a formula for the average height, in centimeters, of girls between the ages of 2 and 20. According to the formula, at what age should a girl expect to be 152.4 centimeters (5 feet) tall?    "

  "body": "Logarithmic Scales logarithm scale logarithmic scale logarithm  Making a Log Scale  Because grows very slowly as increases, logarithms are useful for modeling phenomena that take on a very wide range of values. For example, biologists study how metabolic functions such as heart rate are related to an animal’s weight, or mass. The table shows the mass in kilograms of several mammals.    Animal  Shrew  Cat  Wolf  Horse  Elephant  Whale   Mass, kg         Imagine trying to scale the -axis to show all of these values. If we set tick marks at intervals of 10,000 kg, as shown below, we can plot the mass of the whale, and maybe the elephant, but the dots for the smaller animals will be indistinguishable.  number line with masses of mammals  On the other hand, we can plot the mass of the cat if we set tick marks at intervals of 1 kg, but the axis will have to be extremely long to include even the wolf. We cannot show the masses of all these animals on the same scale.  number line with masses of mammals  To get around this problem, we'll compute the the log of each mass, and use the logs on a new scale. The table below shows the base 10 log of each animal's mass, rounded to 2 decimal places.    Animal  Shrew  Cat  Wolf  Horse  Elephant  Whale   Mass, kg         Log (mass)         The logs of the masses range from -2.40 to 4.85. We can easily plot these values on a single scale, as we shall see. We are going to use a number line on which the tick marks are labeled with powers of 10, because, as you recall, a logarithm is actually an exponent. exponent (logarithm) The number line looks like this. logscale with integer exponents  Before we continue, let's review the conversion equations for logs. For example,  We are not going to plot the logs from the table, we are going to plot powers of 10 that give the actual masses of the animals. For example, the mass of the horse is 300 kg, and we saw that , or So to plot the mass of the horse, we plot . The powers of 10 on our number line are evenly spaced, so we plot about halfway between and .  If we continue to plot the rest of the animals' masses as powers of 10, we get the number line shown below. Even though we computed the log of each mass, we still plotted the actual mass of each animal, in its form as a power of 10. It is the scale on the number line that has changed.  mammal masses plotted on log scale  A scale labeled with powers of 10 is called a logarithmic scale logarithmic scale , or log scale.  To help you get used to this new scale, you can check that the mass of the horse, at 300 kg, is plotted between and on the log scale. Similarly, the mass of the cat, at 4 kg, is plotted between and on the log scale.  Plot the values on a log scale.             We first compute the base 10 logarithm of each number.                     Then we plot each number as a power of 10, estimating its position between powers with integer exponents. For example, we plot the first value, , closer to than to . The finished plot is shown below.  points plotted on log scale   For more examples plotting log scales, see Section 10.2.1 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Complete the table by estimating the logarithm of each point plotted on the log scale below. Then use a calculator to give a decimal value for each point.   points on logscale                                QuickCheck 1 Fill in the blanks to complete each statement.  We use for graphing variables that take on a very wide range of values.  The tick marks on a log scale are labeled with .  To plot values on a log scale, we first compute the of the values.  A fraction less than 1 is plotted on a log scale as a power with a exponent.    Labeling a Log Scale  Before we look more closely at log scales, take a moment to consider how we compare quantities. See Section 10.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Log scales allow us to plot a wide range of values, but there is a trade-off. Equal increments on a log scale do not correspond to equal differences in value, as they do on a linear scale. You can see this more clearly if we label the tick marks with their integer values, as well as powers of 10. The difference between and is , but the difference between and is .  logscale with integer exponents  As we move from left to right on this scale, we multiply the value at the previous tick mark by 10. Moving up by equal increments on a log scale does not add equal amounts to the values plotted; it multiplies the values by equal factors . In the next Example, observe how the integers are plotted on a log scale: they are not evenly spaced.  Plot the integer values 2 through 9 and 20 through 90 on a log scale.  We compute the logarithm of each integer value.                                              We plot the integers on a log scale, as shown below.   log scale showing integer points     On the log scale in , notice how the integer values are spaced: They get closer together as they approach the next power of . If we would like to label a log scale with integers, we get a very different looking scale, one in which the tick marks are not evenly spaced.  Here is a log scale labeled not with powers of , but with integer values, like this:   log scale showing some integers at tick marks    Some applications use log-log graph paper log-log graph paper , which scales both axes with logarithmic scales.  Practice 2 The opening page of Chapter 6 shows the \"mouse-to-elephant\" curve, a graph of the metabolic rate of mammals as a function of their mass. (The elephant does not appear on that graph, because its mass is too big.) The figure below shows the same function, graphed on log-log paper.  mouse-to-elephant curve on log-log graph  Use this graph to estimate the mass and metabolic rate for the following animals, labeled on the graph.    Animal  Mouse  Dog  Sheep  Cow  Elephant   Mass (kg)        Metabolic rate (kcal\/day)         Animal  Mouse  Dog  Sheep  Cow  Elephant   Mass (kg)        Metabolic rate (kcal\/day)        QuickCheck 2 Decide whether each statement is true or false.  Equal increments on a log scale correspond to equal differences in value.  Moving up by equal increments on a log scale multiplies the values by equal factors.  If we label a log scale with integers, the tick marks are evenly spaced.  On log-log graph paper, both axes are labeled with logarithmic scales.    Acidity and the pH Scale  You may have already encountered log scales in some everyday applications. A simple example is the pH scale pH scale acid (pH) scale , used by chemists to measure the acidity of a substance or chemical compound. This scale is based on the concentration of hydrogen ions in the substance, denoted by . The pH value is defined by the formula Values for pH fall between 0 and 14, with 7 indicating a neutral solution. The lower the pH value, the more acidic the substance. Some common substances and their pH values are shown in the table.     Substance  pH    Battery acid     Lemon juice     Vinegar     Milk     Baking soda     Milk of magnesia     Lye     A decrease of 1 on the pH scale corresponds to an increase in acidity by a factor of 10. Thus, lemon juice is 10 times more acidic than vinegar, and battery acid is 100 times more acidic than vinegar.   Calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of .  The water in a swimming pool should be maintained at a pH of 7.5. What is the hydrogen ion concentration of the water?    We use a calculator to evaluate the pH formula with .  We solve the equation for . First, we write Then we convert the equation to exponential form to get The hydrogen ion concentration of the water is .   Practice 3 The pH of the water in a tide pool is 8.3. What is the hydrogen ion concentration of the water?   Decibels  The decibel scale decibel scale , used to measure the loudness or intensity of a sound, is another example of a logarithmic scale. The perceived loudness of a sound is measured in decibels, , by where is the intensity of its sound waves (in watts per square meter). The table below shows the intensity of some common sounds, measured in watts per square meter.    Sound  Intensity (watts\/m )  Decibels   Whisper     Background music     Loud conversation     Heavy traffic     Jet airplane     Thunder     Consider the ratio of the intensity of thunder to that of a whisper: Thunder is , or one billion times more intense than a whisper. It would be impossible to show such a wide range of values on a graph. When we use a log scale, however, there is a difference of only 90 decibels between a whisper and thunder.   Normal breathing generates about watts per square meter at a distance of 3 feet. Find the number of decibels for a breath 3 feet away.  Normal conversation registers at about 40 decibels. How many times more intense than breathing is normal conversation?   We evaluate the decibel formula with to find The sound of breathing registers at 10 decibels.  We let stand for the sound intensity of breathing, and stand for the intensity of normal conversation. We are looking for the ratio . From part (a), we know that and we can calculate from the decibels formula. Finally, we compute the ratio : Normal conversation is 1000 times more intense than breathing.   Practice 4 The noise of city traffic registers at about decibels.   What is the intensity of traffic noise, in watts per square meter?  How many times more intense is traffic noise than conversation?   watts\/m    Both the decibel model and the Richter scale in the next example use expressions of the form . Be careful to follow the order of operations when using these models. We must compute the quotient before taking a logarithm. In particular, keep in mind that can be simplified to .   The Richter Scale Richter scale (or magnitude)  One method for measuring the magnitude of an earthquake compares the amplitude of its seismographic trace with the amplitude of the smallest detectable earthquake. The log of their ratio is the Richter Richter scale (or magnitude) magnitude, . Thus,   The Northridge earthquake of January 1994 registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. What would be the magnitude of an earthquake 100 times as powerful as the Northridge quake?  How many times more powerful than the Northridge quake was the San Francisco earthquake of 1989, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale?    We let represent the amplitude of the Northridge quake and represent the amplitude of a quake 100 times more powerful. From the Richter model, we have or, rewriting in exponential form, Now, we want to be 100 times , so Thus, the magnitude of the more powerful quake is  We let stand for the amplitude of the San Francisco earthquake. We are looking for the ratio . First, we use the Richter formula to compute values for and . Rewriting each equation in exponential form, we have or Now we can compute the ratio we want: The San Francisco earthquake was , or approximately 1.58 times as powerful as the Northridge quake.   Practice 5 In October 2005, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Pakistan. How much more powerful was this earthquake than the 1989 San Francisco earthquake of magnitude 7.1? 3.16   Comparing Quantities on a Log Scale  An earthquake 100, or , times as strong is only two units greater in magnitude on the Richter scale. In general, a difference of units on the Richter scale (or any logarithmic scale) corresponds to a factor of units in the intensity of the quake.  For more about comparing quantities, see Section 10.2.2 of the Toolkit.  On a log scale, the weights of two animals differ by 1.6 units. What is the ratio of their actual weights?  A difference of 1.6 on a log scale corresponds to a factor of in the actual weights. Thus, the heavier animal is , or 39.8 times as heavy as the lighter animal.  Practice 6 Two points, labeled and , differ by units on a log scale. What is the ratio of their decimal values? 316.2  QuickCheck 3 Decide whether each statement is true or false.  An increase of 1 on the pH scale corresponds to an increase in acidity by a factor of 10.  A ratio of sound intensities of one billion corresponds to a difference of 90 decibels.  The second property of logs says that .  A difference of 3 on a log scale corresponds to a ratio of , or 1000.

We can make a table of values for the inverse function by interchanging the columns of a table for .  If we apply the inverse function to the output of , we return to the original input value.  The graphs of and its inverse function are symmetric about the line .  We define the logarithmic function, , which takes the log base of its input values. The log function is the inverse of the exponential function .  Because and are inverse functions for ,   A logarithmic equation is one where the variable appears inside of a logarithm. We can solve logarithmic equations by converting to exponential form.  Steps for Solving Logarithmic Equations   Use the properties of logarithms to combine all logs into one log.  Isolate the log on one side of the equation.  Convert the equation to exponential form.  Solve for the variable.  Check for extraneous solutions.  The natural base is an irrational number called , where  The natural exponential function is the function . The natural log function is the function .  Conversion Formulas for the Natural Base   Properties of Natural Logarithms  If , then    also   We use the natural logarithm to solve exponential equations with base .  Exponential Growth and Decay  The function describes exponential growth if , and exponential decay if .  Continuous compounding : The amount accumulated in an account after years at interest rate compounded continuously is given by where is the principal invested.  A log scale is useful for plotting values that vary greatly in magnitude. We plot the log of the variable, instead of the variable itself.  A log scale is a multiplicative scale : Each increment of equal length on the scale indicates that the value is multiplied by an equal amount.  The pH value of a substance is defined by the formula where denotes the concentration of hydrogen ions in the substance.  The loudness of a sound is measured in decibels, , by where is the intensity of its sound waves (in watts per square meter).  The Richter magnitude, , of an earthquake is given by where is the amplitude of its seismographic trace and is the amplitude of the smallest detectable earthquake.  A difference of units on a logarithmic scale corresponds to a factor of units in the value of the variable.

Verify that is a solution of the equation   We show that substituting for makes the equation true. When we substitute a negative number for a variable, we should enclose the number in parentheses. Because the expression does equal , we see that is a solution.  Verify that is not a solution of the equation   We show that substituting for does not make the equation true.

Use addition and subtraction to get all the variable terms on one side of the equation, and all constsnt terms on the other side.  Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable.    Solve  First, we remove parentheses by applying the distributive law. Then we can combine like terms on each side of the equation.  Note that the minus sign in front of the parentheses on the right side of the equation applies to both terms inside the parentheses.   Solve the inequality  We begin by the same way we solve an equation. For this example, we start by removing the parentheses. Recall that if we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality symbol.

But if they seem to cluster near a line, we can try to find that line.  Sketch a line of best fit for the scatterplot above.  We draw a line that lies as close as possible to all of the data points. As a rule of thumb, we try to keep equal numbers of points on each side of the line.  scatterplot   Which of the lines fits the scatterplot best?  scatterplot Line L   Fit a line through two points  If we don't know the slope of a line, but we do know two points on the line, we can calculate the slope first and then use the point-slope formula.  Find an equation for the line that passes through and .   We solve this problem in two steps: First, find the slope of the line, and then use the point-slope formula.  Step 1: Let and .

Linear Systems  Write equations in two variables  Applied problems that involve more than one unknown are often easier to model and solve with a system of equations.  Write equations about the number of tables and the number of chairs:  There are four chairs for each table.  Chairs cost $125 each; a table costs $350. Darryl spent $10,200 on tables and chairs.    Let be the number of tables and the number of chairs.  The number of chairs is 4 times the number of tables: .    Write equations about the dimensions of a rectangle:  The perimeter of the rectangle is 42 meters.  The length is 3 meters more than twice the width.   Let be the width of the rectangle and its length.     Write equations about the number of calories in a hamburger and in a chocolate shake.  A hamburger and a chocolate shake together contain 1020 calories.  Two shakes and three hamburgers contain 2710 calories.      Write equations about the vertex angle and the base angles of an isosceles triangle.  The vertex angle is less than each base angle.  The sum of the angles in a triangle is .       Identify the solution of a system  Recall that a solution to a system makes each equation in the system true.  Decide whether is a solution of the system   A solution must satisfy both equations. We substitute and into the equations. Yes, is a solution  Find the solution of the system graphed below.  Linear system   The solution must lie on both graphs, so it is the intersection point, . The coordinates of point are , so the solution of the system is .  Decide whether is a solution of the system No  Find the solution of the system graphed below.  Linear system   Use the formula for profit,  Profit  To find the profit earned by a company we subtract the costs from the revenue.  \"Revenue\" is the amount of money a company takes in from selling its product. A negative profit is the same as a loss.  The owner of a sandwich shop spent $800 last week for labor and supplies. She received $1150 in revenue. What was her profit?  We evaluate the formula with and to find The owner's profit was $350.  EcoGreen made $1848 profit on low-flow shower heads last year, and spent $3426 in costs. What was their revenue from shower heads?  We usse the profit formula and solve the equation to find that . Their revenue was $5094.   The Earth Alliance made $6000 in revenue from selling tickets to Earth Day, an educational event for children. Write an expression for their profit in terms of their costs.  What was their profit if their costs were $2500?    $3500   Last week Moe's Auto Shop took in $5400 in revenue, but experienced a loss of $800. What were Moe's costs last week? $6200    Algebraic Solution of Systems  Some familiar formulas are useful in writing equations to solve a problem.  Use the interest formula,  You have $5000 to invest for one year. You want to put part of the money into bonds that pay 7% interest, and the rest of the money into stocks that involve some risk but will pay 12% if successful. Now suppose you decide to invest dollars in stocks and dollars in bonds.  Use the interest formula, , to write expressions for the interest earned on the bonds and on the stocks.  Write an equation about the amount invested.  Write an equation to say that the total interest earned was $400.    Stocks: Bonds:     Mort invested money in two accounts, a savings plan that pays 8% interest and a mutual fund that pays 7% interest. He put twice as much money in the savings plan as in the mutual fund. At the end of the year Mort's total interest income was $345. How much did he invest in each account?  Use the interest formula to write expressions for the interest Mort earned on the savings plan and the interest he earned on the mutual fund.  Write an equation about the amount Mort invested.  Write an equation about the interest Mort earned.        Use the percent formula,  A pharmacist has on hand a solution of a certain medication at 40% strength, but she needs 48 ounces of the medication at 75% strength for a prescription. She decides to add a pure form of the medication to the 40% solution. How much of the each strength solution should she add to make a mixture of 75% strength?  Choose variables for the unknown quantities.  Write an equation about the amount of 75% solution.  Use the percent formula, , to calculate the amount of the medication in the original solution.  Use the percent formula to calculate the amount of the medication in the mixture.  Write an equation about the amount of medication.    Let stand for tthe amount of 40% solution and for the pure solution.        A pet store owner wants to mix a 12% saltwater solution and a 30% saltwater solution to obtain 90 liters of a 24% solution. He uses quarts of the 12% solution and quarts of the 30% solution.  Write an equation about the total amount of saltwater.  Use the percent formula to write expressions about the amount of salt in each original solution.  How many liters of salt are in the mixture?  Write an equation about the amount of salt.         Use the distance formula,  A river steamer requires 3 hours to travel 24 miles upstream and 2 hours for the return trip downstream. Let be the speed of the current and the speed of the steamer in still water.  Write an equation about the upstream trip.  Write an equation about the downstream trip.    The speed of the steamer aginst the current is , so  The speed of the steamer with the current is , so   A yacht leaves San Diego and heads south, traveling at 25 miles per hour. Six hours later a Coast Guard cutter leaves San Diego traveling at 40 miles per hour and pursues the yacht. Let be the time it takes the cutter to catch the yacht, and the distance it traveled.  Write an equation about the yacht's journey.  Write an equation about the cutter's journey.        Gaussian Reduction  Write an equation in standard form  Before we can use Gaussian reduction, we must write each equation in standard form.  Write the equation in standard form.

After the pieces are cut, each racket requires three phases of production: gluing, sanding and finishing. A tennis racket takes 3 hours to glue, 2 hours to sand, and 3 hours to finish. A Ping-Pong paddle takes 1 hour to glue, 1 hour to sand, and 1 hour to finish. A squash racket takes 2 hours to glue, 2 hours to sand, and 2.5 hours to finish. Ace has available 95 labor-hours for gluing, 75 labor-hours for sanding, and 100 labor-hours for finishing per day. How many of each racket should it make in order to use all the available time?  Let , , and stand for the number of tennis rackets, Ping-Pong paddles, and squash rackets, respectively. Write three equations about the number of hours needed for each phase:  Write a 3x3 linear system for the following problem:  A box contains $6.25 in nickels, dimes, and quarters. There are 85 coins in all, with 3 times as many nickels as dimes. How many coins of each kind are there? Let , , and stand for the number of nickels, dimes, and quarters, respectively.     Linear Inequalities in Two Variables  Solve a linear inequality  Before we solve inequalities in two variables, let's review solving linear inequalities in one variable.

Sign Patterns for Quadratic Trinomials  Assume that and are positive integers. Then   If all the coefficients of the trinomial are positive, then both and are positive.   If the middle term of the trinomial is negative and the other two terms are positive, then and are both negative.   If the constant term of the trinomial is negative, then and have opposite signs.   Factor as a product of two binomials,  The constant term is , so we look for two numbers and whose product is . There are three possibilities: Because the middle term is , we must have . We check each possibility and find that and . Thus,   Factor .  For this example we must find two numbers and for which and . These two conditions tell us that and must both be negative.

Evaluate absolute values  The definition of how to take an absolute value may look complicated, but it just says two things:  If the number is positive, leave it alone.  If the number is negative, put another negative in front, which will make the number positive.   Simplify each expression.       The absolute value of any number is positive (or zero). We can think of the absolute value of a number as its distnce from on a number line.  is 3 units from 0, so .  is the opposite of , so .  The opposite of is , so .  is the opposite of , so .

Properties of Logarithms  Let us review some of the algebraic properties we learned earllier as they apply to exponential functions.  Apply the laws of exponents  The laws of exponents still apply to variable exponents. (If you would like to review the laws of exponents, they are listed in Section 3.2.)  Use the laws of exponents to simplify.     When multiplying two powers with the same base, we add the exponents. Notice that the base does not change.     Use the laws of exponents to simplify.     When dividing two powers with the same base, we subtract the exponents.     Use the laws of exponents to simplify.     When raising a power to a power, we multiply the exponents.     Use the laws of exponents to simplify .  Use the laws of exponents to simplify .  Use the laws of exponents to simplify .   Apply the distributive law  Which equation is a correct application of the distributive law?  or  or    The distributive law applies to multiplying a sum or difference, not a product. In the first equation, is a product, so the distributive law does not apply. (We can, however, simplfy that expression with the associative law:  The second equation is a correct application of the distributive law. You can check that the first equation is false and the second equation is true by substituting .  The distributive law applies only to multiplying a sum or product, not to other operations, such as taking logs. You can check that the first equation is false by substituting .  The second equation is a correct application of the distributive law.    Decide whether each equation is a correct application of the distributive law. Write a correct statement if possible.  Correct  Not correct  Not correct.  Not correct   Solve power and exponential equations  Compare the procedures for solving power equations and exponential equations.  Solve .

The number of students at Salt Creek Elementary School is growing according to the formula , where is the number of years since the school opened in 2005.  What does the equation tell us about the school?  Use function notation to say that the student population was 583 in 2007.    In this equation, and . In 2011 (six years after the school opened), the student population was 793.  In 2007, , so .   The value of Digicorp stock has been falling according to the formula , where is the number of weeks since its peak value of $48 per share.  Use function notation to say that 8 weeks later the value of a share of Digicorp stock was $34.63.  What does the equation tell us about the stock?    We evaluate the function at to get .  In this equation, and , so 12 weeks after the peak value a share of Digicorp stock was worth $29.41.   The number of internet users in the United States is given by , where in 2000. Use function notation to say that the number of internet users in 2005 was 146,679,000.   The percent of U.S. households that maintain a landline telephone is decreasing according to the formula , where in 2004. What does the equation tell us about landlines? In 2014, 63% of households maintained a landline.   Doubling time and half-life  Doubling Time and Half-Life  If is the doubling time for an exponential function , then  If is the half-life for an exponential function , then   The half-life of a cold medication in the body is 6 hours. Find its decay rate.  The decay law for the medication is We can rewrite this expression as so , and . The decay rate is 8.3%.  The growth rate of a population of badgers is 3.8% per year. Find its doubling time.  The growth law for the population is . We set and solve for . The doubling time is 18.59 years.  The doubling time for a population is 18 years. Find its annual growth rate. 3.9%  A radioactive isotope decays by 0.04% per second. What is its half-life? 4.81 hrs   Analyze graphs of exponential functions  From a graph, we can read the initial value of an exponential function and then its doubling time or half-life. From there we can calculate the growth or decay law.  The graph shows the population, , of a herd of llamas years after 2000.  How many llamas were there in 2000?  What is the doubling time for the population?  What is the annual growth rate for the population?   exponential growth   The initial value of the population is given by the -intercept of the graph, . There were 15 llamas in 2000.  Look for the time when the initial llama population doubles. When , and when , so the llama population doubles every 4 years.  The growth factor for the population is , so the annual growth rate is 18.9%.  --> Write a decay law for the graph shown below, where is in hours and is in milligrams.  exponential decay  The initial value is given by the vertical intercept of the graph, , so .

Find the LCD for the fractions.        Find the LCD for the fractions.         Build fractions  Before we can add unlike fractions, we must build each fraction to an equivalent one with the LCD as denominator.  Write an equivalent fraction with the new denominator:  We first find the building factor for the fraction: what must we mulitply the old denominator by to get the new denominator? We factor the new denominator to see what factors are missing.  The new denominator is , so we need to multiply the old denominator by . This is the building factor. We multiply top and bottom of the old fraction by the building factor:   Write an equivalent fraction with the new denominator:  The new denominator factors as , so the building factor is .

In 5 hours, it travels 750 miles with a tailwind, but it travels only 600 miles in 5 hours against the wind. Write a system of equations for the speed of the plane and the speed of the wind.   We let stand for the speed of the plane, and stand for the speed of the wind. We use the formula .   Write a system of equations for the problem.  Darryl plans to mix some 50% solution with some 75% solution to make 20 liters of 60% solution. How much of each should he use?  The perimeter of a rectangle is 38 inches. If we triple the width and decrease the length by 8 inches, we increase the area of the rectangle by 40%. What are the dimensions of the original rectangle?  The express train travels 15 miles per hour faster than the local. The local takes 10 minutes longer to travel 30 miles than the express takes. Find the speed of each.  Delbert made $65 interest on his money market account this year. Francine invested $100 less than Delbert at 0.5% higher interest rate and earned $66. How much did Delbert invest, and at what interest rate?   Use substitution  We can use substitution to solve some systems of equations.  Use substitution to write an equation in one variable.  We solve the second equation for to get , and then substitute this expression into the first equation.   Use substitution to write an equation in one variable.      Find the intersection points of the graphs of   We will use substitution to solve the system. First we solve the \"easier\" of the two equations (the second equation) for to obtain We substitute for in the first equation to find This equation has only one variable, , and we solve it by first clearing fractions. We multiply both sides by , and then subtract to obtain Then we factor the left side to get and apply the zero-factor principle to find We solve each of these equations to find Finally, we substitute each of these values into to find the -components of each solution.
