<p>At a constant temperature, the pressure, \(P\text{,}\) and the volume, \(V\text{,}\) of a gas are related by the equation \(PV = K\text{.}\) The product of the pressure (in pounds per square inch) and the volume (in cubic inches) of a certain gas is 30 inch-pounds. If the temperature remains constant as the pressure is increased by 4 pounds per square inch, the volume is decreased by 2 cubic inches. Find the original pressure and volume of the gas.</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">24<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>Kristen drove 50 miles to her sister's house, traveling 10 miles in heavy traffic to get out of the city and then 40 miles in less congested traffic. Her average speed in the city was 20 miles per hour less than her speed in light traffic. What was each rate if her trip took 1 hour and 30 minutes?</p></article>
