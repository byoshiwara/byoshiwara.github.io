<p>Finding the maximum or minimum value for a variable expression is a common problem in applications. For example, if you own a company that manufactures blue jeans, you might like to know how much to charge for your jeans in order to maximize your revenue. As you increase the price of the jeans, your revenue may increase for a while. But if you charge too much for the jeans, consumers will not buy as many pairs, and your revenue may actually start to decrease. Is there some optimum price you should charge for a pair of jeans in order to achieve the greatest revenue?</p>
