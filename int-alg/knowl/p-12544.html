<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The horizontal axis of the ellipse has length \(2a\text{,}\) and the vertical axis has length \(2b\text{,}\) the same as for central ellipses. When \(a \gt b\text{,}\) the major axis is horizontal and the ellipse is short and wide. When \(a \lt b\text{,}\) the major axis is vertical and the ellipse is tall and narrow, as shown below.</p>

Her average speed in the city was 20 miles per hour less than her speed in light traffic. What was each rate if her trip took 1 hour and 30 minutes?</p>
