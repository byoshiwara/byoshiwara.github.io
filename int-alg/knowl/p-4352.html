<p>Not all quadratic equations have solutions that are real numbers.  For example, when we try to solve the equation \(~x^2+4=0,~\text{,}\) we find</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
x^2 \amp =-4\\
x \amp = \pm \sqrt{-4}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Although square roots of negative numbers such as \(\sqrt{-4}\)  are not real numbers, they occur frequently in mathematics and its applications.  Mathematicians in the sixteenth century gave them the name <dfn class="terminology">imaginary numbers</dfn>, which reflected the mistrust with which they were viewed at the time.  Today, however, such numbers are well understood and are used routinely by scientists and engineers.</p>
