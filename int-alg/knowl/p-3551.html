<p>We would like to know when the baseball was exactly 52 feet high. To find out, we must solve the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
-16t^2+64t+4 = 52
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where we have substituted 52 for the height, \(h\text{.}\) We can use the graph to solve this equation, by finding points with \(h\)-coordinate 52. You can see that there are two such points, with \(t\)-coordinates 1 and 3, so the baseball is 52 feet high at 1 second, and again on the way down at 3 seconds.</p>
