<p>A solar energy company sold $80,000 worth of solar collectors last year, its first year of operation. This year its sales rose to $88,000. The marketing department must estimate its projected sales for the next 3 years.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow linearly, what sales total should it expect next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next 3 years, assuming that sales will grow linearly.</li>
<li>If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow exponentially, what sales total should it expect next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next 3 years, assuming that sales will grow exponentially.</li>
