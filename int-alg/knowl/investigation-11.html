</h4> <div class="para">The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used by hikers, pilots, surveyors, automobiles to determine their location (latitude, longitude, and elevation) anywhere on the surface of the earth. The system depends on a collection of satellites in orbit around the earth. Each GPS satellite transmits its own position and the current time at regular intervals.</div> <div class="para">A person with a GPS receiver on earth can calculate his or her distance from the satellite by comparing the time of transmission with the time when it receives the signal. Of course, there are many points at the same distance from the satellite—in fact, the set of all points at a certain distance <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> from the satellite lie on a sphere centered at the satellite. That is why there are several satellites: You calculate your position by finding the intersection point of several such spheres centered on different satellites.</div> <div class="para">We will consider a simplified, two-dimensional model of a GPS system in which the satellites and the receiver all lie in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane instead of in three-dimensional space.</div> <div class="para">In this model we’ll need data from two GPS satellites. The satellites are orbiting along a circle of radius 100 meters centered at the origin. You have a receiver inside that circle and would like to know the coordinates of your position within the circle.</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/fig-gps-grid.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="grid"></div> <div class="para">To make the computations simpler, we will also assume that the satellite transmissions travel at 5 meters per second.</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">A signal from Satellite A arrives 18 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite A?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The signal says that Satellite A was located at <span class="process-math">\((100, 0)\)</span> at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite A.</div></li>

<li><div class="para">The signal says that Satellite B was located at <span class="process-math">\((28, 96)\)</span> at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite B.</div></li>

<li><div class="para">Your position must lie at the intersection point, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> of your two graphs. Estimate the coordinates of your position from the graph. (Remember that you are within the orbits of the satellites.)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Later in this chapter you will learn how to find the coordinates of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> algebraically by solving a system of equations. Verify that the ordered pairs <span class="process-math">\((28, 54)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((68.32, 84.24)\)</span> both satisfy the equations you wrote in part (3) and part (6).
