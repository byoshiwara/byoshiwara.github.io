<li><p>A signal from Satellite A arrives 18 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite A?</p></li>
<li><p>The signal says that Satellite A was located at \((100, 0)\) at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite A.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (2).</p></li>
<li><p>A signal from Satellite B arrives 8.4 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite B?</p></li>
<li><p>The signal says that Satellite B was located at \((28, 96)\) at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite B.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (5).</p></li>
<li><p>Your position must lie at the intersection point, \(P\text{,}\) of your two graphs. Estimate the coordinates of your position from the graph. (Remember that you are within the orbits of the satellites.)</p></li>
<li><p>Later in this chapter you will learn how to find the coordinates of \(P\) algebraically by solving a system of equations. Verify that the ordered pairs \((28, 54)\) and \((68.32, 84.24)\) both satisfy the equations you wrote in part (3) and part (6). What are the coordinates of \(P\text{?}\)</p></li>
