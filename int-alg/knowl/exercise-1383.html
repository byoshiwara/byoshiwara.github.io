<div class="para">A new car begins to depreciate in value as soon as you drive it off the lot. Some models depreciate linearly, and others depreciate exponentially. Suppose you buy a new car for $20,000, and 1 year later its value has decreased to $17,000.</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
