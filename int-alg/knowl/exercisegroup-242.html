<p>Carbon-14 occurs in living organisms with a fixed ratio to nonradioactive carbon-12. After a plant or animal dies, the carbon-14 decays into stable carbon with a halflife of 5730 years. When samples from the Shroud of Turin were analyzed in 1988, they were found to have 91.2% of their original carbon-14. How old were those samples in 1988?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">26<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>Rubidium-strontium radioactive dating is used in geologic studies to measure the age of minerals. Rubidium-87 decays into strontium-87 with a half-life of 48.8 billion years. Several meteors were found to have 93.7% of their original rubidium. How old are the meteors?</p></article>
