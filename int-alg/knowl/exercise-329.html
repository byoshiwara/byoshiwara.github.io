<div class="para">Office Depot makes three types of file cabinets: two-drawer, four-drawer, and horizontal. The building process is divided into three phases: assembly, painting, and finishing. A two-drawer cabinet requires 3 hours to assemble, 1 hour to paint, and 1 hour to finish. The four-drawer model takes 5 hours to assemble, 90 minutes to paint, and 2 hours to finish. The horizontal cabinet takes 4 hours to assemble, 1 hour to paint, and 3 hours to finish. Office Depot employs enough workers for 500 hours of assembly time, 150 hours of painting, and 230 hours of finishing each week. How many of each type of file cabinet should they make in order to use all the hours available?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="GaussReduct.html#exercise-329" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
