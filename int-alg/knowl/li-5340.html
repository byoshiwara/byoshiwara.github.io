<div class="para">The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to 15 miles per hour, Francine’s flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly 15 miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at <span class="process-math">\(x = 15\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">What about negative values for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{?}\)</span> If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine’s flying time should decrease for negative <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(x = -5\text{,}\)</span> there is a tailwind of 5 miles per hour, so Francine’s effective speed is 20  miles per hour, and she can complete the flight in 3 hours. As the tailwind gets stronger (that is, as we move farther to the left in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-direction), Francine’s flying time continues to decrease, and the graph approaches the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="AlgebraicFractions.html#li-5340" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
