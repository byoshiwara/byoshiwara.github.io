<p>Two pilots for the Flying Express parcel service receive packages simultaneously.  Orville leaves Boston for Chicago at the same time Wilbur leaves Chicago for Boston. Each pilot selects an air speed of 400 miles per hour for the 900-mile trip. The prevailing winds blow from east to west.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Express Orville's flying time as a function of the wind speed.</li>
<li>Write a function for Wilbur's flying time.</li>
<li>Who reaches his destination first? By how much time (in terms of wind speed)?</li>
