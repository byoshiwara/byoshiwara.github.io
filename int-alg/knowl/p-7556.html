<p>Birds’ eggs typically lose 10%–20% of their mass during incubation. The embryo metabolizes lipid during growth, and this process releases water vapor through the porous shell. The incubation time for birds’ eggs is a function of the mass of the egg and has been experimentally determined as</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
I(m) = 12.0 m^{0.217}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(m\) is measured in grams and \(I\) in days. (Source: Burton, 1998)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Calculate the incubation time (to the nearest day) for the wren, whose eggs weigh about 2.5 grams, and the greylag goose, whose eggs weigh 46 grams.</li>
<li>The rate of water loss from the egg is also a function of its mass and appears to follow the rule<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
W(m) = 0.015 m^{0.742}
\end{equation*}
</div>Combine the functions \(I(m)\) and \(W(m)\) to calculate the fraction of the initial egg mass that is lost during the entire incubation period.</li>
<li>Explain why your result shows that most eggs lose about 18% of their mass during incubation.</li>
