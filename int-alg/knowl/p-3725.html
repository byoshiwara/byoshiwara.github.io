<p>Delbert stands at the top of a 300-foot cliff and throws his algebra book directly upward with a velocity of 20 feet per second. The height of his book above the ground \(t\) seconds later is given by the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h=-16t^2+20t+300
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(h\) is in feet.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Use your calculator to make a table of values for the height equation, with increments of 0.5 second.</li>
<li>Graph the height equation on your calculator. Use your table of values to help you choose appropriate WINDOW settings.</li>
<li>What is the highest altitude Delbert's book reaches? When does it reach that height? Use the TRACE feature to find approximate answers first. Then use the Table feature to improve your estimate.</li>
<li>When does Delbert's book pass him on its way down? (Delbert is standing at a height of 300 feet.) Use the intersect command.</li>
<li>Write and solve an equation to answer the question: How long will it take Delbert's book to hit the ground at the bottom of the cliff?</li>
