<p>A bicycle ergometer is used to measure the amount of power generated by a cyclist. The scatterplot shows how long an athlete was able to sustain variouslevels of power output. The curve is the graph of</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y = 500x^{0.29}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">which approximately models the data. (Source: Alexander, 1992)</p>

<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>As represented by the graph, which variable is the input, and which is the output?</li>
<li>The athlete maintained 650 watts of power for 40 seconds.  What power output does the equation predict for 40 seconds?</li>
<li>The athlete maintained 300 watts of power for 10 minutes. How long does the equation predict that power output can be maintained?</li>
<li>In 1979 a remarkable pedal-powered aircraft called the Gossamer Albatross was successfully flown across the English Channel. The flight took 3 hours. According to the equation, what level of power can be maintained for 3 hours?</li>
<li>The Gossamer Albatross needed 250 watts of power to keep it airborne. For how long can 250 watts be maintained, according to the equation?</li>
