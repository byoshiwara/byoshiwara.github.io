<p>Many quadratic models arise as the product of two variables, one of which increases while the other decreases. For example, in the Activities for Section 3.2 we looked at the areas of different rectangles with the same perimeter. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and its width, or \(A=lw\text{.}\)  If we require that the rectangle have a certain perimeter, then as we increase its length, we must also decrease its width.</p>
