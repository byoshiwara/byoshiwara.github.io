<div class="para">Systems of equations are useful in many applied problems. One example involves supply and demand. The owner of a retail business must try to balance the demand for his product from consumers with the supply he can obtain from manufacturers. Supply and demand both vary with the price of the product: consumers usually buy fewer items if the price increases, but manufacturers will be willing to supply more units of the product if its price increases.</div>
