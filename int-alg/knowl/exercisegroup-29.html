<p>In Problems 23–26, we find a linear model from two data points.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Make a table showing the coordinates of two data points for the model. (Which variable should be plotted on the horizontal axis?)</p></li>
<li><p>Find a linear equation relating the variables.</p></li>
<li><p>State the slope of the line, including units, and explain its meaning in the context of the problem.</p></li>

<p>Flying lessons cost $645 for an 8-hour course and $1425 for a 20-hour course. Both prices include a fixed insurance fee.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write an equation for the cost, \(C\text{,}\) of flying lessons in terms of the length, \(h\text{,}\) of the course in hours. <em class="emphasis">Hint</em>: Find two points \((h, C)\) given in the problem. Find the equation of the line through those points.</p></li>
