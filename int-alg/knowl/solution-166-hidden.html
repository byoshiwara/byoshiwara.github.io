<div class="para">The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in figure (a). It begins at the origin because at the instant Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when <span class="process-math">\(t = 0, y = 0\text{.}\)</span>) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrestâ€™s walking speed.</div>

</li>
<li><div class="para">The first part of the graph is the same as part (a). But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in figure (b). The line has slope <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The graph begins like the graph in part (b). The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in figure (c).</div></li>
