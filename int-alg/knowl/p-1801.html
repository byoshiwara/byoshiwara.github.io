<p>A biologist wants to know the average weights of two species of birds in a wildlife preserve. She sets up a feeder whose platform is actually a scale and mounts a camera to monitor the feeder. She waits until the feeder is occupied only by members of the two species she is studying,  robins and thrushes. Then she takes a picture, which records the number of each species on the scale and the total weight registered.</p>
