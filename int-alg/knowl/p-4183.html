<p>After it lands on Earth, the distance the space shuttle travels is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
d=vT+\dfrac{v^2}{2a}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(v\) is the shuttle's velocity in ft/sec at touchdown, \(T\) is the pilot's reaction time before the brakes are applied, and \(a\) is the shuttle's deceleration.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Suppose that for a particular landing, \(T=0.5\) seconds and \(a=12\) ft/sec. Write the equation for \(d\) in terms of \(v\text{,}\) using these values.</li>
<li>Find the coordinates of the vertex and the horizontal intercepts of the graph of your equation.  Use these points to help you graph the equation.</li>
<li>Explain the meaning of the vertex and the intercepts, if any, in this context. As \(v\) increases, what happens to \(d\text{?}\)</li>
<li>The runway at Edwards Air Force base is 15,000 feet long. Graph your equation again in an appropriate (larger) window, and use it to estimate the answer to the question:  What is the maximum velocity the shuttle can have at touchdown and still stop on the runway?</li>
