<p>Birds’ eggs typically lose 10%–20% of their mass during incubation. The embryo metabolizes lipid during growth, and this process releases water vapor through the porous shell. The incubation time for birds’ eggs is a function of the mass of the egg and has been experimentally determined as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
I(m) = 12.0 m^{0.217}
