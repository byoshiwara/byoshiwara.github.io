<p>The ability to model problems or phenomena by algebraic expressions and equations is the ultimate goal of any algebra course. We motivate the skills and techniques of algebra by placing them in the context of simple applications. Each chapter begins with an interactive Investigation that gives students an opportunity to explore open-ended modeling problems. These Investigations can be used in class as guided explorations or as projects for small groups. They are designed to show students how the mathematical techniques they are learning can be applied to study and understand new situations.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#paragraphs-1">in-context</a></span>
