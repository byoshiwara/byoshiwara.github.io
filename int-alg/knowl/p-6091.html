<div class="para">In 1965, Gordon Moore, the cofounder of Intel, observed that the number of transistors on a computer chip had doubled every year since the integrated circuit was invented. Moore predicted that the pace would slow down a bit, but the number of transistors would continue to double every 2 years. More recently, data density has doubled approximately every 18 months, and this is the current definition of <dfn class="terminology">Moore’s law</dfn>. Most experts, including Moore himself, expected Moore’s law to hold for at least another two decades.</div>
