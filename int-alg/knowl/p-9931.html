<p>In the 1940s David Lack undertook a study of the European robin. He tagged 130 one-year-old robins and found that on average 35.6% of the birds survived each year. (Source: Burton, 1998.)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>According to the data, how many robins would have originally hatched to produce 130 one-year-olds?</li>
<li>Write a formula for the number of the original robins still alive after \(t\) years.</li>
<li>Graph your function on your calculator.</li>
<li>One of the original robins actually survived for 9 years. How many robins does the model predict will survive for 9 years?</li>
