<p>No tool for conveying information about a system is more powerful than a graph. Yet many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more global view. We encourage students to become more involved with graphs by providing blank grids with appropriately scaled axes for most problems. These ready-made grids remove some of the drudgery of graphing and allow students to focus on the properties of the graphs, such as intercepts and slope, and on interpreting the information given by the graph. Later, we take advantage of graphing calculators to examine large numbers of examples and study them in more detail than is possible when every graph is plotted by hand. We consider more realistic models in which calculations by more traditional methods are difficult or impossible.</p>
