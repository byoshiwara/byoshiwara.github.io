<p>We can tell that \(f\) is an exponential function because its values increase by a factor of 3 for each unit increase in \(x\text{.}\) The base of the function is \(b=3\text{.}\) We also see from the table that \(a=f(0)=2\text{,}\) so \(f(x)=2(3^x)\text{.}\) Thus, \(h\) must be the power function, \((x)=kx^3\text{.}\) To find \(k\text{,}\) we notice that \(h(1)=k\text{,}\) so \(k=2\text{,}\) and \(h(x)=2x^3\text{.}\)</p>
<p>As you would expect, the graphs of the two functions are also quite different. In particular, note that the power function passes through the origin, while the exponential function approaches the negative \(x\)-axis as a horizontal asymptote.</p>
<p>From the table, we see that \(h(3) = f(3) = 54\text{,}\) so the two graphs intersect at \(x = 3\text{.}\) (They also intersect at approximately \(x = 2.48\text{.}\)) However, if you compare the values of \(h(x) = 2x^3\) and \(f(x) = 2(3^x)\) for larger values of \(x\text{,}\) you will see that eventually the exponential function overtakes the power function.</p>
