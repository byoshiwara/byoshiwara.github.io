<p>The incubation time for birds’ eggs is given by</p>

\begin{equation*}
I(m) = 12.0 m^{0.217}

\begin{equation*}
O(m) = 22.2 m^{0.77}

<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Combine the functions \(I(m)\) and \(O(m)\) to calculate the total amount of oxygen taken in by the egg during its incubation.</li>
<li>Use your result from part (a) to explain why total oxygen consumption per unit mass is approximately inversely proportional to incubation time. (Oxygen consumption is a reliable indicator of metabolic rate, and it is reasonable that incubation time should be inversely proportional to metabolic rate.)</li>
<li>Predict the oxygen consumption per gram of a herring gull’s eggs, given that their incubation time is 26 days. (The actual value is 11 milliliters per day.)</li>
