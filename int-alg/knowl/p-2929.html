<p>We can choose any point for the test point as long as it does not lie on the boundary line. We chose \((0, 0)\) in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-linear-inequality-test-point.html" title="Example 2.51">Example 2.51</a> because the coordinates are easy to substitute into the inequality. If the test point is a solution, we shade the half-plane including that point. If the test point is not a solution, we shade the other half-plane. For example, suppose we had chosen \((5, 0)\) as the test point in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-linear-inequality-test-point.html" title="Example 2.51">Example 2.51</a>. When we substitute its coordinates into the inequality, we find</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
3(\alert{5}) - 2(\blert{0}) \lt 6
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">which is a false statement. Thus, \((5, 0)\) is not a solution to the inequality, so the solutions must lie on the other side of the boundary line. Note that using \((5, 0)\) as the test point gives us the same solutions we found in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-linear-inequality-test-point.html" title="Example 2.51">Example 2.51</a>.</p>
