<p>No tool for conveying information about a system is more powerful than a graph. Yet many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more global view. We encourage students to become more involved with graphs by providing blank grids with appropriately scaled axes for most problems. These ready-made grids remove some of the drudgery of graphing and allow students to focus on the properties of the graphs, such as intercepts and slope, and on interpreting the information given by the graph. Later, we take advantage of graphing calculators to examine large numbers of examples and study them in more detail than is possible when every graph is plotted by hand. We consider more realistic models in which calculations by more traditional methods are difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>We have incorporated the use of graphing technology into the text wherever they can be used to enhance understanding. Technology use is not simply an add-on, but in many ways shapes the organization of the material. The text includes instructions for the TI-83 graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility. We have not attempted to use all the features of the calculator or to teach calculator use for its own sake, but in all cases have let the mathematics suggest how technology should be used.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#paragraphs-3">in-context</a></span>
