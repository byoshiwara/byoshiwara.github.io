<p>Not surprisingly, scientists would like to understand the causes of sea-level change as thoroughly as possible, and to measure the rate of sea-level rise as accurately as possible. Using data from satellites and floats (mechanical devices drifting in the ocean), oceanographers at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory have calculated that the sea level rose, on average, 3 millimeters (0.1 inches) per year between 1995 and 2005. The graph below shows the change in mean sea level, measured in millimeters, over that time period.</p>
