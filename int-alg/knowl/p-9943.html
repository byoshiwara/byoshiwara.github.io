<p>On January 10, the college infirmary treated 4 cases of flu. One week later, the total number of flu cases had grown to 6.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>If the number of cases grew linearly, what was its weekly rate of growth?</li>
<li>If the number of cases grew exponentially, what was its weekly growth factor?  What was its weekly percent increase?</li>
<li>Predict the number of flu cases 6 weeks later under each assumption, linear or exponential growth.</li>
<li>Write a function for the number of flu cases under each assumption. Graph both functions for 10 weeks from January 10.</li>
</ol>
