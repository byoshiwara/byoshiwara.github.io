<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Each section of the text includes Examples followed by a similar Practice Exercise that students can try for themselves in WeBWorK.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also "QuickCheck" exercises, usually multiple choice or fill in the blanks, for students to check their understanding of the concepts presented.</p></li>
<li><p>Homework problems come in three groups: a short Skills Warm Up that reviews prerequisite skills for the section, then Skills Practice with new skills, and finally Applications.</p></li>
<li><p>We have included a variety of applied problems that we hope students (and their teachers) will find interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, each Chapter begins with an Investigation that can be used as a group project or as a guided in-class activity.</p></li>
