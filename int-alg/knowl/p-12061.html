<li><p>A signal from Satellite A arrives 18 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite A?</p></li>
<li><p>The signal says that Satellite A was located at <span class="process-math">\((100, 0)\)</span> at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite A.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (2).</p></li>
<li><p>A signal from Satellite B arrives 8.4 seconds after it was transmitted. How far are you from Satellite B?</p></li>
<li><p>The signal says that Satellite B was located at <span class="process-math">\((28, 96)\)</span> at the time of transmission. Use a compass to sketch a graph showing your possible positions relative to Satellite B.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an equation for the graph you sketched in part (5).</p></li>
<li><p>Your position must lie at the intersection point, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> of your two graphs. Estimate the coordinates of your position from the graph. (Remember that you are within the orbits of the satellites.)</p></li>
<li><p>Later in this chapter you will learn how to find the coordinates of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> algebraically by solving a system of equations. Verify that the ordered pairs <span class="process-math">\((28, 54)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((68.32, 84.24)\)</span> both satisfy the equations you wrote in part (3) and part (6). What are the coordinates of <span class="process-math">\(P\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
