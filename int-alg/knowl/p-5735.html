<div class="para">Birds’ eggs typically lose 10%–20% of their mass during incubation. The embryo metabolizes lipid during growth, and this process releases water vapor through the porous shell. The incubation time for birds’ eggs is a function of the mass of the egg and has been experimentally determined as</div>
