<div class="para">A farmer has 1300 acres on which to plant wheat, corn, and soybeans. The seed costs $6 for an acre of wheat, $4 for an acre of corn, and $5 for an acre of soybeans. An acre of wheat requires 5 acre-feet of water during the growing season, while an acre of corn requires 2 acre-feet and an acre of soybeans requires 3 acre-feet. If the farmer has $6150 to spend on seed and can count on 3800 acre-feet of water, how many acres of each crop should he plant in order to use all his resources?</div>
