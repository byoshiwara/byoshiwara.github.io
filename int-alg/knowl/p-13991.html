<p>If a cone is cut by a plane parallel to its axis, the intersection is a <dfn class="terminology">hyperbola</dfn>, the only conic section made of two separate pieces, or <dfn class="terminology">branches</dfn>.  Hyperbolas occur in a number of applied settings.  The navigational system called LORAN (long-range navigation) uses radio signals to locate a ship or plane at the intersection of two hyperbolas.  Satellites moving with sufficient speed will follow an orbit that is branch of a hyperbola; for example, a rocket sent to the moon must be fitted with retrorockets to reduce its speed in order to achieve an elliptical, rather than hyperbolic, orbit about the moon.</p>
