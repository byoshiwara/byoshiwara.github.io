<div class="para">Ace, Inc. produces three types of wooden rackets: tennis rackets, Ping-Pong paddles, and squash rackets. After the pieces are cut, each racket requires three phases of production: gluing, sanding and finishing. A tennis racket takes 3 hours to glue, 2 hours to sand, and 3 hours to finish. A Ping-Pong paddle takes 1 hour to glue, 1 hour to sand, and 1 hour to finish. A squash racket takes 2 hours to glue, 2 hours to sand, and 2.5 hours to finish. Ace has available 95 labor-hours for gluing, 75 labor-hours for sanding, and 100 labor-hours for finishing per day. How many of each racket should it make in order to use all the available time?</div>
