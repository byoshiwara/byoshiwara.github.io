<div class="para">The climate of a region has a great influence on the types of animals that can survive there. Extreme temperatures create difficult living conditions, so the diversity of wildlife decreases as the annual temperature range increases. Along the west coast of North America, the number of species of mammals, <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> is approximately related to the temperature range, <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> (in degrees Celsius) by the function</div>

\begin{equation*}
M = f(R) = 433.8R^{-0.742}
