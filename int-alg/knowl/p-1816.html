<p>Every point on the graph of an equation represents a solution to that equation. A solution to both equations must be a point that lies on both graphs. Therefore, a solution to the system is a point where the two graphs intersect. The figure at right shows a graph of the system about robins and thrushes. The two lines appear to intersect at the point \((4, 6)\text{,}\) so we expect that the values \(t = \alert{4}\) and \(r = \alert{6}\) are the solution to the system. We can check by verifying that these values satisfy both equations in the system.</p>
