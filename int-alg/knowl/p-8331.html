<p>If energy consumption were proportional to body weight, the graph would be a straight line. But this graph is concave down, or bends downward. Larger species eat less than smaller ones, relative to their body weight. For example, a moose weighs 600 times as much as a squirrel, but its energy requirement is only 121 times the squirrel's.</p>
