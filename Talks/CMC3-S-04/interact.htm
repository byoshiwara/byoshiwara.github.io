<h1>Interactive Lessons in Excel</h1>
<h3><a name="example">Examples</a></h3>
<p>My favorite interactive lesson was created by my colleague Bob Martinez. He 
  wrote &quot;Terminate the Terminator&quot; in Mathcad, and I translated it to 
  the Excel file terminator.xls.</p>
<p>You can certainly create interactive lessons without any special bells and 
  whistles, but you sometimes have to work to make life easy for the user.</p>
<p>Several of the interactive lessons I've created use macros to determine the 
  action of clicking on a button, etc. Excel automatically disables macros under 
  High (the default) security level. To be given the option of accepting or rejecting 
  macros, click on Tools-&gt;Macro-&gt;Security..., and chooose Medium.</p>
<p>The polar.xls file can be considered a weakly interactive lesson, as it demonstrates 
  the use of &quot;option buttons&quot; (a.k.a &quot;radio buttons&quot;). I first 
  played with these controls (or widgets) in buttons.xls. I also briefly looked 
  at a more sophisticated set of controls in compare.xls.</p>
<p>You can see the other uses of controls in the files riemann.xls, grapher.xls, 
  rowops.xls, and fractions.xls (the last file requires loading the Analysis TookPak 
  from the Excel installation disk). </p>
<p>Creating your own basic controls is fairly simple. First make sure that the 
  necessary control icons are available in Excel. Press View-&gt;Toolbars and 
  make sure that the &quot;Forms&quot; box is checked. (We are NOT using the &quot;Control 
  Toolbox&quot; icons, which are more versatile but slightly more effort to set 
  up.)</p>
<p>The controls icons should look something like this.</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>When you position the cursor above one of the control icons (while that window 
  is active), the name of the control will be displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="scroll" id="scroll"></a>Scroll Bars and Spinners</h3>
<p>Scroll (or slider) bars and spinners give the user an easy way to vary a parameter. 
  These two types of controls are used side-by-side in the file buttons.xls. The 
  scroll bar can be oriented either vertically or horizontally, but the spinner 
  is oriented only up and down. (Excel may eventually allow other orientations). 
</p>
<p>When oriented vertically, the scroll bar is increasing downwards, while the 
  spinner is increasing upwards. In the riemann.xls file, a scroll bar is provided 
  so that the user can use the mouse to vary the number of intervals by clicking 
  or dragging.</p>
<p>We will create both a slider bar and a spinner to compare and contrast the 
  two similar control types.</p>
<h3>Creating scroll bars</h3>
<p>Open a new file. Click on the <a href="#controlicons">Scroll Bar icon</a>. 
  (It consists of a stack of two squares, with an up arrow in the upper square, 
  and a down arrow in the lower square.) Drag a short, wide rectangle to get a 
  horizontal scroll bar. If you don't like the shape, you can drag a handle to 
  re-shape the scroll bar. </p>
<p>When the rectangle is wider than tall, the scroll bar is horizontal; if the 
  rectangle is taller than wide, the scroll bar is vertical. You can also drag 
  the scroll bar around. If you lose the handles, right-click on the slider, then 
  press ESC.</p>
<p>Right-click on the scroll bar, then select &quot;Format Control&quot;.Select 
  the &quot;Control&quot; tab. Change the &quot;Current value&quot; to 50, check 
  that the Minimum value is 0, the Maximum value is 100, the Incremental change 
  is 1, and the Page change is 10.</p>
<p>Click on the button at the right of the &quot;Cell link:&quot; box. Click on 
  the box D1, then close the pop-up Format Control box. Next, click on OK to close 
  the Format Object window.</p>
<p>Select cell D3 and type</p>
<p>=(d1-50)/10</p>
<p>and Enter.</p>
<p>Try clicking on the scroll bar or dragging the tab in its middle.</p>
<h3>Creating a <a name="spinner"></a>Spinner</h3>
<p>Click on the <a href="#controlicons">Spinner icon</a>. (It should be next to 
  the scroll bar icon, and it consists of two up and down triangles separted by 
  a horizontal line.) Drag a tall, thin rectangle to get a spinner. Re-shape as 
  desired. </p>
<p>Right-click on the spinner, then select &quot;Format Control&quot;. Set the 
  &quot;Current value&quot; to 10, the Minimum value to 0, the Maximum value to 
  20, the Incremental change to 1, and the Cell link to $F$1. Click on OK to close 
  the Format Object window.</p>
<p>Select cell F3 and type</p>
<p>=(f1-10)/2</p>
<p>and Enter.</p>
<p>Enter -10 in A1 and -9.5 in A2. Select both cells, then drag the lower right 
  corner of A2 down to A41. In cell B1 enter</p>
<p>=d$3*a1+f$3</p>
<p>then select B1 and double-click on the lower right corner of the cell to &quot;black-cross 
  copy&quot; the contents of that cell into B2:B41.</p>
<p>Select the data in A1:B41 and create an XY (Scatter) graph: Click on the chart 
  icon, select the XY (Scatter) icon and the &quot;Scatter with data points connected 
  by smoothed Lines without markers&quot; sub-type. </p>
<p>After clicking Next, select the Series tab and check that the X Values are 
  from column A and the Y Values are from column B. (The name of the current sheet, 
  probably &quot;Sheet1,&quot; is also shown in the input boxes.) Click Next. 
</p>
<p>Make the Chart title</p>
<p>y = ax + b</p>
<p>check the Major Gridlines on both axes, un-check the Show Legend, and click 
  Finish.</p>
<p>Double-click on the x-axis and format the Scale so that the minimum is -10, 
  the maximum is 10, the major unit is 5, and the minor unit is 1. The &quot;Auto&quot; 
  boxes for those values should all be un-checked. Double-click on the y-axis 
  and format it in the same way.</p>
<p>Now the scroll bar controls the slope of the line and the spinner the y-intercept. 
  Position the scroll bar (remember you can right-click and press Esc to select 
  an control) just below D3, and position the spinner just below F3. Type the 
  letters &quot;a&quot; in D2 and &quot;b&quot; in F2. Make the font in those 
  cells large and colorful.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="option"></a>Check Boxes, Option Buttons, List and Combo Boxes</h3>
<p>There are several controls to allow the user to select an option. For example, 
  the user might be specifying a family of functions, a method for manipulating 
  an object, or parameters to be used. Use option buttons, list boxes, or combo 
  boxes when choices are mutually exclusive. Use check boxes when various options 
  can occur together, or if there is only a single option to be toggled on and 
  off..</p>
<p>We'll look at options buttons first.</p>
<h3>Creating <a name="option"></a>option buttons</h3>
<p>We will put two option buttons above the graph but below the scroll bar and 
  spinner. (Move the graph if needed.)</p>
<p>Click on the <a name="group"></a><a href="#controlicons">Group Box icon</a> 
  (it has &quot;XYZ&quot; above 3 sides of a rectangle) , then drag a rectangle. 
  Click on the text &quot;Group Box&quot; and make the title &quot;Curve type.&quot;</p>
<p>Select the <a href="#controlicons">Option Button icon</a>, then drag a wide 
  short rectangle completely within the top half of the group box. Change the 
  text to read &quot;Straight line y = ax+b.&quot;</p>
<p>Right-click on the option button and select Format Control. Click on the Control 
  tab, make the Value &quot;Checked&quot; and type in the Cell link &quot;H1.&quot; 
  Click OK.</p>
<p>Now create a second option button just below the first. Label it &quot;Exponential 
  y = a*e^(bx).&quot;</p>
<p>In cell H2 enter</p>
<p>=if(h1=1,1,0)</p>
<p>(This says, &quot;If the value in H1 is 1, assign the value 1, otherwise assign 
  the value 0.&quot;) See what happens in cells H1 and H2 when you toggle between 
  choices of &quot;Curve type.&quot; </p>
<p>We want to define the values in column B to correspond to a linear function 
  when &quot;Straight line&quot; is chosen and to an exponential function when 
  &quot;Exponential&quot; is chosen. Define B1 as</p>
<p>=h$2*(d$3*a1+f$3)+(1-h$2)*d$3*exp(f$3*a1)</p>
<p>and black-cross copy that cell into B2:B41. </p>
<p>Try clicking on the second curve type and playing with the slider button and 
  spinner. </p>
<p>When offering more than just two options, you might consider giving &quot;names&quot; 
  to the functions and parameters. (See the &quot;technical issues&quot; in the 
  polar.xls file and the discussion &quot;E. Naming Functions and Variables&quot; 
  in &quot;II. Creating Graphs for Handouts and Exams&quot;--start by following 
  the second link on the left.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="list"></a>List Boxes and <a name="combo"></a>Combo Boxes</h3>
<p>Type &quot;Linear&quot; in H3 and &quot;Exponential&quot; in H4. Click on th 
  <a href="#controlicons">List Box icon</a> and then drag a rectangle next to 
  the &quot;Curve type&quot; group box. </p>
<p>Right-click on your list box and select Format Control. Click on the button 
  at the right of the Input range box, select cells H3 and H4, and close the Format 
  Object window. Type H1 in the Cell link box, and click OK.</p>
<p>Click off the list box, then click on either choice.</p>
<p>Click on the <a href="#controlicons">Combo Box icon</a> and then drag another 
  rectangle. Right-click on your combo box select Format Control, and use the 
  same settings as for your list box.</p>
<p>Click off your combo box, click on the down arrow to see the drop-down menu, 
  and make you selection.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><a name="check"></a>Check Boxes</h3>
<p>Setting up a <a href="#controlicons">Check Box</a> is basically the same as 
  setting up a option button. But you typically do not use check boxes in a group 
  box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="macros" id="macros"></a>Macros</h3>
<p>A macro is a collection of actions you expect to do many times. Defining a 
  macro mainly involves turning on a recorder, carrying out the actions, and turning 
  off the recorder. Sometimes Excel is configured so that turning on and off the 
  recorder is accompolished by clicking on buttons made to look like tape recorder 
  buttons, but sometimes turning a recording off is accomplished by selecting 
  Tools from the menubar, then Macro-&gt;Stop recording.</p>
<p>We will define a macro to associate with the scroll bar that will assign the 
  appropriate formula to cell D3. </p>
<p>First notice that if you type a number in D3, say 10, the scroll bar no longer 
  affects the cell.</p>
<p>Right-click on the scroll bar and select Assign macro. Click on the Record 
  button, click on OK. In cell D3 type </p>
<p>=(d1-50)/10</p>
<p>and press enter. Stop recording (either by pressing the appropriate button 
  or by selecting Tools-&gt;Macro-&gt;Stop recording).</p>
<h4><a name="warn"></a>Warning</h4>
<p>The cell references in the macro can be corrupted by inserting or deleting 
  cells in the worksheet. If a working macro goes awry after inserting or deleting 
  cells, you may need to re-record (or edit) the macros. You can delete a macro: 
  select Tools-&gt;Macro-&gt;Macros, select the appropriate name, then click on 
  Delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="button"></a>Buttons</h3>
<p>You create a button by clicking on the <a href="#controlicons">Button icon</a> 
  and dragging a rectangle where you want the button to be. You must assign a 
  macro to the button for it to serve any function.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><a name="pretty"></a>Making it pretty</h3>
<p>Select cells A1:B41. Change the font color to white (either using the Font 
  Color icon from the toolbar, or Format-&gt;Cells-&gt;Font, changing the Color 
  from Automatic to white).</p>
<p>Do the same for cells D1, F1, H1:H4.</p>
<p>Select D3 and make its background yellow (either using the Fill Color icon 
  from the toolbar, or Format-&gt;Cells-&gt;Patterns and clicking on a yellow 
  square). Do the same in cell F3.</p>
<p>Remove the gridlines and the column and row headings: Click on Tools-&gt;Options, 
  and on the View tab un-check &quot;Gridlines&quot; and &quot;Row &amp; column 
  headers.&quot;</p>
<p>If you decide to make a nice title for the page, be sure to notice the <a href="#warn">warning</a> 
  above before you try to insert a new row at the top of the sheet. You can make 
  a wide cell for your text by selecting two adjacent cells and clicking the merge 
  and center icon (next to the right justify button). Or you can create a Text 
  Box over several cells. (See the instructions for making Labels and arrows under 
  &quot;Samples&quot; in <a href="index2.html" target="_top">II. Creating Graphs 
  for Handouts and Exams</a> .)</p>
