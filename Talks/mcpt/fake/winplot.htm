<H2><A href="http://math.exeter.edu/rparris/peanut/wp32z.exe">Winplot</A> for 
Windows 95/98/ME/2K/XP (547K) (28 Sept 2005)</H2>
<P>Winplot is a general-purpose plotting utility, which can draw (and animate) 
curves and surfaces presented in a variety of formats. Although this program is 
meant to closely resemble the old <A 
href="http://math.exeter.edu/rparris/oldwp.html">Windows 3.1 version</A>, it is 
incompatible with it, meaning that neither program can open files created by the 
other. This version includes several <A 
href="http://math.exeter.edu/rparris/wpnew.html">improvements</A>, and <A 
href="http://math.exeter.edu/rparris/wpnew.html">network versions</A> are 
available. 
<HR>
<A href="http://math.exeter.edu/rparris/wpsupp.html">Supplementary material</A> 
(<STRONG>28 Jun 2005</STRONG> ) This means animations, tutorials, teaching 
modules, and a font. Donated mostly by Winplot users.

<HR>
<STRONG>28 Sept:</STRONG> The Mapping windows now allow the composition of 
mappings in the Two|Combinations dialog. 
<HR>
<STRONG>8 Sept:</STRONG> A user pointed out a bug in my parser, which shows 
itself when you divide one expression by a constant trigonometric expression, as 
in "cos(x)/cos(0.5)". It is now fixed, I think. 
<HR>
<STRONG>16 Aug:</STRONG> A teacher suggested some improvements to the 
secant-tangent demos. You can also now put arrows at the ends of segments in 
3-dim drawings. 
<HR>
<STRONG>14 Aug:</STRONG> A user pointed out that double-clicking an inventory 
item ought to open the edit dialog. Now it does. 
<HR>
<STRONG>6 Aug:</STRONG> At the request of several users, the 2-dim program will 
now find the intersection of two implicitly defined curves. Please report any 
glitches --- this was more complicated to program than you might think. 
<HR>
<STRONG>12 Jul:</STRONG> At the request of several users, you can now put arrows 
at the ends of segments in 2-dim drawings. 
<HR>
<STRONG>29 May:</STRONG> The format of tables (column width and decimal places) 
can now be controlled by the user. 
<HR>
<STRONG>6 May:</STRONG> Oops! Yesterday's updates were incorrectly compiled, 
causing some menu items to be grayed out. Sorry for the inconvenience, but 
please download again. 
<HR>
<STRONG>5 May:</STRONG> The increased resolution feature installed on 10 March 
can now be disabled by those users who would rather not have the added file 
size. In addition, it is now possible to assign a filename to the graphical 
display, using the Windows enhanced metafile format. In 3D, many users were 
being mystified by the strange effects caused by not specifying a bounding box 
for sequences and differential equations, since the default examples install 
rather large boxes. The program now prompts the user for box information when 
the example is first created, just as it does for implicit examples. 
<HR>
<STRONG>24 Apr:</STRONG> It was possible for z-axis Tours in 3-dim windows to 
cause a loss of system resources. A repair has been made. 
<HR>
<STRONG>2 Apr:</STRONG> In the user-defined function dialog, the horizontal 
scroll bar was not appearing when it was supposed to. Now it is. 
<HR>
<STRONG>23 Mar:</STRONG> Sérgio de Albuquerque Souza sent me this remarkable <A 
href="http://www.mat.ufpb.br/~sergio/winplot/dominio-n-retangulares.html">link</A>. 
It shows how parametric equations allow a creative Winplot user to escape the 
confines of functions defined on rectangular domains. 
<HR>
<STRONG>10 Mar:</STRONG> A long-overdue improvement, which should please those 
users who paste Winplot diagrams into MS Word documents. These embedded figures 
have been printing for years at screen resolution (which means very low 
resolution), but --- thanks to a suggestion from an user --- they should now 
print with maximum resolution. Also fixed two bugs: One caused a crash when 
polar-coordinate points were highlighted with arcs. Another bug caused sporadic 
crashes when the program closed. 
<HR>
<STRONG>17 Feb:</STRONG> Supplementary text inserted into a diagram can now be 
rotated. 
<HR>
<STRONG>1 Feb:</STRONG> Posted the <A 
href="http://math.exeter.edu/rparris/peanut/wpit32z.exe">Italian version</A> 
today. While preparing it, I inadvertently mixed up the English and Italian 
versions of the 3D File help text, so if you downloaded the English version 
yesterday, please do it again today! 
<HR>
<STRONG>31 Jan:</STRONG> Minor corrections: The text windows (help files, 
notebooks, tables) were losing their carets (the blinking thing) now and then, 
and were not opening files correctly. Also fixed another small error that 
allowed faulty initialization data to occasionally gum up the 2D zoom function. 
<HR>
<STRONG>17 Jan:</STRONG> The observer coordinates in 3D can now be viewed and 
manipulated using spherical coordinates. While modifying this dialog box, I 
noticed that the plotting of points in spherical coordinates had been ruined by 
an improvement I made on 31 Dec 2004. So, if you have downloaded the program 
since then, you'll want to do it again. 
<HR>
<STRONG>15 Jan:</STRONG> It seems that the old "search" function that I 
installed years ago in text windows no longer works under Windows XP, so I had 
to revise it. 
<HR>
<STRONG>11 Jan:</STRONG> Fixed a small but annoying glitch, which caused the 
program to misinterpret some data when the number of displayed decimal digits 
was set to 0. 
<HR>
<STRONG>10 Jan:</STRONG> Enabled the full array of constructors joina, joinb, 
..., joinz for piecewise-defined functions. These are useful for parametrized 
examples. 
<HR>
<STRONG>6 Jan:</STRONG> The foreign-language versions suffered during the 
previous update --- their main menus were all disabled. Sorry about that! 
<HR>
<STRONG>3 Jan:</STRONG> In 2D, the delete button in the Inventory should have 
been disabled while polynomial editing was in progress. Now it is.
