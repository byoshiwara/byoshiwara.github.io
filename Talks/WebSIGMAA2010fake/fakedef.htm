<h1>What is Wolfram|Alpha? </h1>
<p class="style2">If you ask Wolfram|Alpha,&quot;<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=what+are+you%3F" target="_blank">What are you?</a>&quot;,
the response is</p>
<p class="style3">&quot;I am a computational knowledge engine.&quot; </p>
<p class="style2">Wolfram|Alpha provides a conceptual <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/images/home-popup.png">map</a>. </p>
<p><img src="../../Loci%20Draft2/home-popup.png" width="734" height="694"></p>
<p class="style2">And the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/about.html" target="_blank">mission statement</a>  says: </p>
<p class="style2">&quot;Wolfram|Alpha's long-term goal is to make all systematic knowledge immediately computable and accessible to everyone...to provide a single source that can be relied on by everyone for definitive answers to factual queries. We aim to collect and curate all objective data; implement every known model, method, and algorithm; and make it possible to compute whatever can be computed about anything. Our goal is to build on the achievements of science and other systematizations of knowledge to provide a single source that can be relied on by everyone for definitive answers to factual queries.</p>
<p class="style2">&quot;Wolfram|Alpha aims to bring expert-level knowledge and capabilities to the broadest possible range of people&mdash;spanning all professions and education levels. Our goal is to accept completely free-form input, and to serve as a knowledge engine that generates powerful results and presents them with maximum clarity.&quot;</p>
<h2>How do you find documentation? </h2>
<p class="style2">(Under the FAQs:) Is there a manual for Wolfram|Alpha?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  <span class="style3">&quot;Wolfram|Alpha works by taking free-form linguistic input, so there's no need for a manual as such. Check out the Examples by Topic to get a sense of what Wolfram|Alpha can do.&quot;</span>
