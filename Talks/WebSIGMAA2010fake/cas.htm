<h1>Are you kidding?</h1>
<p class="style3">&quot;Oh, no! My online students are going to cheat!&quot; </p>
<blockquote class="style3">
  <p class="style4">Yes, but they have already been cheating. There are more efficient ways for students to get homework (or unproctored exam) answers, and open source CAS's have already been available for years. </p>

<p class="style3">&quot;We don't need to change anything so long as we ban students from using Wolfram|Alpha on exams.&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style5">Although we can probably get away with testing our students on mastery of the  pencil-and-paper algorithms that were common test items a few decades ago,</span> <span class="style2">does someone really need to know how to build an engine before being allowed to  drive a car?</span> </p>
