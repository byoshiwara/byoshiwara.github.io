  <h2>Paper Folding and Conic Sections</h2>
  <p>Here’s a classic problem.  (Heron of Alexandria gave a solution ca. 100 C.E.)  
    A campsite is located in a large, flat clearing near a straight river.  The 
    camper is at point <i>A</i> and the tent is at point <i>B</i>.  The tent catches 
    fire, and fortunately the camper already has a bucket in hand.  At what point 
    <i>P</i> on the river should the camper fill the bucket with water to make 
    the shortest possible path to douse the fire?</p>

  <h3>Activity 1</h3>
  <p>Copy the points <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> and the line <i>l</i> representing 
    the river onto a clean sheet of (patty) paper.  Fold the paper along the river, 
    and mark the point <i>B’</i> which lies directly on <i>B</i> when the paper 
    is folded.  Clearly all the points on <i>l</i> are equidistant to <i>B</i> 
    and <i>B’</i> (even after we unfold the paper). </p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=179

  <p>In other words, the total distance of traveling from <i>A</i> to a point 
    <i>P</i> on the river and then to <i>B</i> is the same distance as traveling 
    from <i>A</i> to the point <i>P</i> and then to <i>B’</i>.  The camper should 
    head to the point on the river in line with the point <i>B’</i> because the 
    shortest distance from <i>A</i> to <i>B’</i> is the straight path. </p>
  <p>Nature uses optimal paths.  The point <i>P</i>  is where a billiards player 
    should aim a cue ball positioned at <i>A</i> if the cue ball is to bounce 
    off the cushion (in place of the river) to strike a ball at <i>B</i> (assuming 
    the player is not putting “English” on the ball). Light travels in paths to 
    minimize time, so the path the camper should take corresponds to the path 
    light will take if river is replaced by a mirror and the camper simply wants 
    to see the reflection of the burning tent.  The point <i>B’</i> is called 
    the <i>reflection of B across</i> <i>l</i>.  </p>
  <p>Because the vertical angles formed by the river and the line from <i>A</i> 
    to <i>B’</i> are congruent, and because the base angles of the isosceles triangle 
    <i>P-B-B’</i> are also congruent, we see that the point <i>P</i> satisfies 
    the property that “the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.</p>
  <p>Of course <i>l</i> is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining 
    <i>B</i> to <i>B’</i>, but the important property for us is that all points 
    on <i>l</i> are equidistant to <i>B</i> and <i>B’</i>.</p>
  <h3>Activity 2</h3>
  <p>On a clean sheet of (patty) paper, mark a black dot about 2 centimeters above 
    the bottom edge of the paper, and label the dot with an “<i>F</i>.”  Mark 
    any point on the bottom edge of the paper and fold the paper until that new 
    point lies directly above the first dot.  Make a neat crease in the paper.</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=179
height=179 src="Conics_files/image005.jpg">   <img width=179 height=179
src="Conics_files/image006.jpg"></p>
  <p>Unfold the paper, choose a second point on the bottom edge, and fold to put 
    this new point directly over the point <i>F</i>.  Crease carefully.  Repeat 
    this creasing process for a few dozen relatively evenly spaced points across 
    the bottom edge.  The creases should create a curve winding partially around 
    <i>F</i>.  This curve is a <i>parabola</i>.</p>
  <p><b>What's going on?</b></p>
  <p>When we fold the sheet so that one point lies directly over another, the 
    crease is along the line equidistant from the two points (the perpendicular 
    bisector of the segment joining the two points).</p>
  <p>If we examine a single crease from Activity 2, we have a line that is equidistant 
    to the point <i>F</i> and a point on the bottom edge of the paper.  We call 
    <i>F</i> our <b>focus</b> and the bottom edge is part of the line we call 
    our <b>directrix</b>.  A parabola consists of all the points that are equidistant 
    to a focus and a directrix.  (The distance from a point to a line is the distance 
    to the nearest point on the line.)  </p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=162
height=169 src="Conics_files/image007.jpg"><img width=238 height=167

  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Disclaimer:  The drawings are not accurate!</span></p>
  <p>Let us call our point on the bottom edge <i>G</i>.  Of all the points along 
    the crease, the point <i>P</i> that is directly above <i>G</i> has a special 
    property, namely, that <i>P</i> is the same distance from <i>F</i> as it is 
    from the bottom edge.   Or in other words, <i>P</i> lies on our parabola.  
  </p>
  <p>If we take any other point on the crease, its closest point on the bottom 
    edge is no longer <i>G</i>, so the new point is closer to the bottom edge 
    than it is to <i>G</i>.  On the other hand, the new point is still equidistant 
    to <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>, so it is closer to the bottom edge than it is to 
    <i>F</i>.  This means that the new point on the crease is too low to be on 
    the parabola.  So aside from the point <i>P</i>, all the points on the parabola 
    are above the crease.  The parabola touches but does not cross the crease 
    at <i>P</i>, or in other words, <u>the crease is a tangent line</u> to the 
    parabola.</p>
  <p>A light ray or a billiard ball will reflect off a curve as if reflecting 
    off the tangent line.  So a ray of light emanating from the focus will reflect 
    off the parabola as if it is reflecting off the crease.  The fold and the 
    vertical line through P form congruent vertical angles.  Also, the fold bisects 
    the angle FPG.  These two facts give us that the acute angle that FP makes 
    with the fold is congruent to the acute angle that the fold makes with the 
    vertical ray going up from P.  In other words, a ray of light emanating from 
    the focus reflects off the parabola to travel straight up (perpendicular to 
    the directrix, parallel to the <i>axis</i> of the parabola). </p>
  <p>A light bulb placed at the focal point of a parabolic mirror will have its 
    light reflected in parallel lines, a property used in flashlights and automobile 
    headlights.  Light or other electromagnetic waves traveling in lines parallel 
    to the axis will reflect off a parabolic dish towards a collector at the focus, 
    which is how satellite dishes and reflecting telescopes work.  </p>
  <h3>Activity 3</h3>
  <p>On a clean sheet of (patty) paper, draw a large circle and mark a black dot 
    inside the circle, but off center.   Label the dot with an “<i>F</i>.”  Pick 
    a point on the circle and fold the paper until <i>F</i> lies directly above 
    that new point, making a neat crease in the paper.</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=179
height=179 src="Conics_files/image010.jpg">        <img width=236 height=159
src="Conics_files/image011.jpg">   </p>
  <p>Unfold the paper, choose a second point on the circle, and fold to put <i>F</i> 
    directly above this new point.  Crease and repeat for a few dozen relatively 
    evenly spaced points on the circle.  The creases create a curve inside the 
    circle.  This oval is an <i>ellipse</i>.</p>
  <p>An ellipse is the set of all points whose sum of distances to two foci is 
    a constant.  The constant is the length of the major axis of the ellipse.  
    In Activity 3, one focus is the point <i>F</i> and the other focus is <i>C</i>, 
    the center of the circle.  A crease is a line that is equidistant to the focus 
    <i>F</i> and a point <i>G</i> on the circle.  </p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=230
height=156 src="Conics_files/image012.jpg"><img width=231 height=159

  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Disclaimer:  The drawings are not accurate!</span></p>
  <p>Consider the point <i>P</i> that is on both the crease and also on the radius 
    from <i>C</i> to <i>G</i>.  The distance from <i>C </i>to <i>G</i> is the 
    radius <i>r</i>.  On the other hand, because <i>P</i> is equidistant to <i>F</i> 
    and <i>G</i>, the sum of the distances from <i>P</i> to <i>C</i> and to <i>F</i> 
    is <i>r</i>.   Or in other words, <i>P</i> lies on an ellipse whose major 
    axis shares the same length as the radius of the given circle.  (We could 
    also describe an ellipse as the set of points that are equidistant to a circle 
    and a point inside the circle.)</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=232
height=164 src="Conics_files/image014.jpg"></p>
  <p>If we take any other point on the crease, it is no longer on the radius to 
    <i>G</i>, so the sum of its distances to the two foci exceeds the radius of 
    the circle (because of the triangle inequality).  Thus any other point on 
    the crease is outside the ellipse, and so the crease is a tangent line to 
    the ellipse.</p>
  <p>As with the parabola, the crease bisects the angle <i>FPG</i>, and the crease 
    also creates vertical angles with the radius to <i>G</i>.  The angle made 
    by the segment <i>FP</i> with the crease is congruent to the angle made by 
    <i>CP</i> with the crease.  So a ray emanating from one focus reflects off 
    the point <i>P</i> on the ellipse towards the other focus.</p>
  <p>Elliptical domes, such as the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City or the 
    Capitol in Washington DC, create “whispering galleries” where even a pin dropped 
    at one focus can be heard a more than a hundred feet away at the other focus.  
    The sound waves from the whisper all travel the same distance to bounce off 
    the ceiling to meet simultaneously at other focus.  A non-surgical treatment 
    of kidney stones also uses the reflection property of the ellipse.  In Extracorporeal 
    Shock Wave Lithotripsy, the patient is placed so that the kidney stone positioned 
    at one focus of an ellipse.  A high energy sound wave is created at the other 
    focus, and it reflects off all parts of an elliptical tank wall to break up 
    the kidney stone.</p>
  <h3>Activity 4</h3>
  <p>On a clean sheet of (patty) paper, draw a small circle and mark a black dot 
    outside the circle, labeling the dot “<i>F</i>.”  Mark a point on the circle, 
    and fold the paper until <i>F</i> lies directly above that new point, making 
    a neat crease in the paper.</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=179
height=179 src="Conics_files/image015.jpg">      <img width=136 height=177
src="Conics_files/image016.jpg"></p>
  <p>Repeat for a few dozen relatively evenly spaced points on the circle.  The 
    creases create two curves.  The two pieces together form a <i>hyperbola</i>.</p>
  <p>A hyperbola is the set of all points whose difference of distances to two 
    foci is a constant.  In Activity 4, the foci are again the point <i>F</i> 
    and the center of the circle,<i> C</i>.  As with the ellipse, a crease is 
    a line that is equidistant to the focus <i>F</i> and a point <i>G</i> on the 
    circle.  </p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=138
height=177 src="Conics_files/image017.jpg">      <img width=140 height=165
src="Conics_files/image018.jpg">     <img width=139 height=175
src="Conics_files/image019.jpg"></p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Disclaimer:  The drawings are not accurate!</span></p>
  <p>Consider the point <i>P</i> that is on both the crease and also on the ray 
    from <i>C</i> through <i>G</i>.  The radius <i>r </i>is the difference in 
    distances between <i>C </i>and <i>P </i>and between <i>P</i> and <i>G</i>.  
    On the other hand, because <i>P</i> is equidistant to <i>F </i>and <i>G</i>, 
    <i>r </i>is the difference in distances between <i>C </i>and <i>P </i>and 
    between <i>P</i> and <i>F</i>.   Or in other words, <i>P</i> lies on a hyperbola, 
    and the radius of the given circle is the difference between the distances 
    to the two foci.  </p>
  <p>If we take any other point on the crease, it is no longer on the ray through 
    <i>G</i>, so the difference of its distances to the two foci is less than 
    the radius of the circle.  Thus any other point on the crease lies on the 
    same side the hyperbola as the near focus, and so, the crease is a tangent 
    line to the hyperbola.</p>
  <p>As with the other two conic sections, the crease bisects the angle <i>FPG</i>, 
    and the crease also creates vertical angles with the ray through <i>G</i>.  
    The angle made by the segment <i>FP</i> with the crease is congruent to the 
    angle made by <i>CP</i> with the crease.  So a ray emanating from one focus 
    reflects off the point <i>P</i> on the hyperbola as if it had emanated from 
    the other focus.  This has the effect of spreading out any waves emanating 
    from a focus.  Hyperbolic shapes are used for horns, street lamps, and space 
    heaters.</p>
  <p>In the Cassegrain telescope design, the primary <i>parabolic</i> mirror reflects 
    light towards a focal point.  A secondary, <i>hyperbolic</i> mirror is positioned 
    so that one of its foci coincides with the focus of the parabola and the other 
    is the collector behind a hole in the primary mirror.  The advantage of the 
    Cassegrain design over the traditional reflection telescope is that the Cassegrain 
    telescope can be much more compact.</p>
