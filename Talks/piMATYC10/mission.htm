<h1>The <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/about.html" target="walpha">mission statement</a>  says: </h1>
<p class="style2">&quot;Wolfram|Alpha's long-term goal is to make all systematic knowledge immediately computable and accessible to everyone...to provide a single source that can be relied on by everyone for definitive answers to factual queries. We aim to collect and curate all objective data; implement every known model, method, and algorithm; and make it possible to compute whatever can be computed about anything. Our goal is to build on the achievements of science and other systematizations of knowledge to provide a single source that can be relied on by everyone for definitive answers to factual queries.</p>
<p class="style2">&quot;Wolfram|Alpha aims to bring expert-level knowledge and capabilities to the broadest possible range of people&mdash;spanning all professions and education levels. Our goal is to accept completely free-form input, and to serve as a knowledge engine that generates powerful results and presents them with maximum clarity.&quot;</p>
