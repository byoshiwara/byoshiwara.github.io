<p>The manager for Books for Cooks plans to spend \(\$300\) stocking a new diet cookbook. The paperback version costs her \(\$5\text{,}\) and the hardback costs \(\$10\text{.}\) She finds that she will sell three times as many paperbacks as hardbacks. How many of each should she buy? </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>Let \(x\) represent the number of hardbacks and \(y\) the number of paperbacks she should buy. Write an equation about the cost of the books.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a second equation about the number of each type of book.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph both equations and solve the system. (Find the intercepts of the graphs to help you choose a window.) Answer the question in the problem.</p></li>
