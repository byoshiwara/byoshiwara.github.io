<p>A small company borrows $800 for start-up costs and agrees to repay the loan at interest rate r, compounded annually. This means that each year the debt is increased by a factor of \(1 + r\text{.}\)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>Write expressions for the amount of money the company will owe if it repays the loan after \(2\) years, after \(3\) years, or after \(4\) years.</p></li>
<li><p>Expand the expressions you found in part (a) as polynomials.</p></li>
<li><p>How much money will the company owe after \(2\) years, after \(3\) years, or after \(4\) years at an interest rate of \(12\%\text{?}\)</p></li>
