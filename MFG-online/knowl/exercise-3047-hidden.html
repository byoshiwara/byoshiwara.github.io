<body><article class="exercise-like"><p>Etienne plans to open a coffee house, and he has \(\$7520\) to spend on furniture. A table costs \(\$460\text{,}\) and a chair costs \(\$120\text{.}\) Etienne will buy four chairs for each table. How many tables can he buy? </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>Let \(x\) represent the number of tables Etienne should buy, and let \(y\) represent the number of chairs. Write an equation about the cost of the furniture.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a second equation about the number of tables and chairs.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph both equations, solve the system, and answer the question in the problem. (Find the intercepts of the graphs to help you choose a window.)</p></li>
