<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>\(D = b^2 - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4(1)(-3) = 13 \gt 0\text{.}\) The equation has two real, unequal solutions. Because \(13\) is not a perfect square, the solutions will be irrational numbers, so the equation cannot be solved by factoring.</li>
<li>\(D = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4(2)(1) = -7 \lt 0\text{.}\) The equation has two complex solutions, which cannot be found by factoring.</li>
<li>\(D = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-3) = 16 \gt 0\) The equation has two real, unequal solutions. Because \(16 = 4^2\text{,}\) the solutions are rational numbers and can be found by factoring.</li>
