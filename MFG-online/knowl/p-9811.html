<p>The formula \(T = \dfrac{\log 2 \cdot t_i}{3 \log(D_f /D_0)}\) is used by X-ray technicians to calculate the doubling time of a malignant tumor. \(D_0\) is the diameter of the tumor when first detected, \(D_f\) is its diameter at the next reading, and \(t_i\) is the time interval between readings, in days. Calculate the doubling time of the following tumor: its diameter when first detected was \(1\) cm, and \(7\) days later its diameter was \(1.05\) cm.</p>
