<p>Ruth wants to provide cookies for the customers at her video rental store. It takes \(20\) minutes to mix the ingredients for each batch of peanut butter cookies and \(10\) minutes to bake them. Each batch of granola cookies takes \(8\) minutes to mix and \(10\) minutes to bake. Ruth does not want to use the oven more than \(2\) hours a day or to spend more than \(2\) hours a day mixing ingredients. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>Write a system of inequalities for the number of batches of peanut butter cookies and granola cookies Ruth can make in one day and graph the solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Ruth decides to sell the cookies. If she charges \(25\)¢ per peanut butter cookie and \(20\)¢ per granola cookie, she will sell all the cookies she bakes. Each batch contains \(50\) cookies. How many batches of each type of cookie should she bake to maximize her income? What is the maximum income?</p></li>
