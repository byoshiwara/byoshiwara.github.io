<p>If you walk in the normal way, your maximum speed, \(v\text{,}\) in meters per second, is limited by the length of your legs, \(r\text{,}\) according to the formula</p>
\begin{equation*}
v=\sqrt{gr} 
\end{equation*}
<p>where the constant \(\) is approximately \(10\) meters per second squared. (Source: Alexander, 1992) </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>A typical adult man has legs about \(0.9\) meter long. How fast can he walk?</p></li>
<li><p>A typical four-year-old has legs \(0.5\) meter long. How fast can she walk?</p></li>
<li><p>Graph maximum walking speed as a function of leg length.</p></li>
<li><p>Race-walkers can walk as fast as \(4.4\) meters per second by rotating their hips so that the effective length of their legs is increased. What is that effective length?</p></li>
<li><p>On the Moon the value of \(g\) is \(1.6\) meters per second squared. How fast can a typical adult man walk on the Moon?</p></li>
