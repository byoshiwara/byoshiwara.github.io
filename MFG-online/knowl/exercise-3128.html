<p>A farmer has \(1300\) acres on which to plant wheat, corn, and soybeans. The seed costs \(\$6\) for an acre of wheat, \(\$4\) for an acre of corn, and \(\$5\) for an acre of soybeans. An acre of wheat requires \(5\) acre-feet of water during the growing season, while an acre of corn requires \(2\) acre-feet and an acre of soybeans requires \(3\) acre-feet. If the farmer has \(\$6150\) to spend on seed and can count on \(3800\) acre-feet of water, how many acres of each crop should he plant in order to use all his resources?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Systems-of-Linear-Equations-in-Three-Variables.html#exercise-3128">in-context</a></span>
