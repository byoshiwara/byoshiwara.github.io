<p>Membership in the County Museum has been increasing since it was built in \(1980\text{.}\) The number of members is given by the function</p>
\begin{equation*}
M(t) = 72 + 100 t^{1/3}
\end{equation*}
<p>where \(t\) is the number of years since \(1980\text{.}\) </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>How many members were there in \(1990\text{?}\) In \(2000\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>In what year will the museum have \(400\) members? If the membership continues to grow according to the given function, when will the museum have \(500\) members?</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the function \(M(t)\text{.}\) How would you describe the growth of the membership over time?</p></li>
