<p>Geologists have estimated the speed of this sea-floor spreading by recording the age of the rocks on the sea floor and their distance from the ridge. (The age of the rocks is calculated by measuring their magnetic polarity. At known intervals over the last four million years, the Earth reversed its polarity, and this information is encoded in the rocks.) (Source: Open University, 1998)</p>
