<p>Studies on pine plantations in the 1930s showed that as the trees grow and compete for space, some of the die, so that the density of trees per unit area decreases. The average mass of an individual tree is a power function of the density, \(d\text{,}\) of the trees per unit area, given by</p>
\begin{equation*}
M(d) = kd^{-1.5}
\end{equation*}
<p>This formula is known as the \(\frac{-3}{2}\) <em class="terminology">self-thinning law</em>. (Source: Chapman and Reiss, 1992) </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>To simplify the calculations, suppose that a pine tree is shaped like a tall circular cone and that as it grows, its height is always a constant multiple of its base radius, \(r\text{.}\) Explain why the base radius of the tree is proportional to the square root of the area the tree covers. Write \(r\) as a power function of \(d\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Write a formula for the volume of the tree in terms of its base radius, \(r\text{.}\) Use part (b) to write the volume as a power function of \(d\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The mass (or weight) of a pine tree is roughly proportional to its volume, and the area taken up by a single tree is inversely proportional to the plant density, \(d\text{.}\) Use these facts to justify the self-thinning law.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Sketch a graph of the function \(M\text{.}\) You do not have enough information to put scales on the axes, but you can show the shape of the graph.</p>
