<p>The graph of the function is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-graph-time-against-headwind.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-graph-time-against-headwind" alt="Figure 7.71 " title="Figure 7.71 ">FigureÂ 7.71</a>. You can use your calculator with the window</p>
\begin{align*}
\text{Xmin} \amp = -8.5 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 15\\
\text{Ymin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 30
\end{align*}
<p>to verify the graph. In particular, the point \((0, 4)\) lies on the graph. This point tells us that if there is no wind, Francine can fly \(60\) miles in \(4\) hours, as we calculated earlier.</p>

<p>The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to \(15\) miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly \(15\) miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at \(x = 15\text{.}\)</p>
<p>What about negative values for \(x\text{?}\) If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine's flying time should decrease for negative \(x\)-values. For example, if \(x = -5\text{,}\) there is a tailwind of \(5\) miles per hour, so Francine's effective speed is \(20\)  miles per hour, and she can complete the flight in \(3\) hours. As the tailwind gets stronger (that is, as we move farther to the left in the \(x\)-direction), Francine's flying time continues to decrease, and the graph approaches the \(x\)-axis.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Graphing-Rational-Functions.html#li-7937">in-context</a></span>
