<body><article class="exercise-like"><p>Leon is flying his plane to Au Gres, Michigan. He maintains a constant altitude until he passes over a marker just outside the neighboring town of Omer, when he begins his descent for landing. During the descent, his altitude, in feet, is given by</p>
\begin{equation*}
A(x) = 128x^3 - 960x^2 + 8000
\end{equation*}
<p>where \(x\) is the number of miles Leon has traveled since passing over the marker in Omer. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>What is Leonâ€™s altitude when he begins his descent?</p></li>
<li><p>Graph \(A(x)\) in the window \begin{align} \text{Xmin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 5\\ \text{Ymin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 8000 \end{align}</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Trace</em> feature to discover how far from Omer Leon will travel before landing. (In other words, how far is Au Gres from Omer?)</p></li>
<li><p>Verify your answer to part (c) algebraically.</p></li>
