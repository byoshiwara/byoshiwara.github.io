<p>Shortly after the arrival of human beings at the Hawaiian islands around 400 A.D., many species of birds became extinct. Fossils of \(29\) different species have been found, but some species may have left no fossils for us to find. We can estimate the total number of extinct species using a proportion. Of \(9\) species that are still alive, biologists have found fossil evidence of \(7\text{.}\) (Source: Burton, 1998) </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>Assuming that the same fraction of extinct species have left fossil records, calculate the total number of extinct species</p></li>
<li><p>Give two reasons why this estimate may not be completely accurate.</p></li>
