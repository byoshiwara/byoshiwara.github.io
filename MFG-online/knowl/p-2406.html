<p>In this problem we will calculate the efficiency of swimming as a means of locomotion. A swimmer generates power to maintain a constant speed in the water. If she must swim against an opposing force, the power increases. The following table shows the power expended by a swimmer while working against different amounts of force. (A positive force opposes the swimmer, and a negative force helps her.) (Source: diPrampero et al., 1974, and Alexander, 1992)</p>
