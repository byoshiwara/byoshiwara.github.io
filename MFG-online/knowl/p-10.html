<p>We have incorporated graphing calculators into the text wherever they can be used to enhance understanding. Calculator use is not simply an add-on, but in many ways shapes the organization of the material. The text includes instructions for the TI-84 graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility. We have not attempted to use all the features of the calculator or to teach calculator use for its own sake, but in all cases have let the mathematics suggest how technology should be used.</p>
