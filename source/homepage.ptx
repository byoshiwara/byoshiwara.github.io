  If you are reading this page on a computer screen or similarly large display, there should be a "Calc" button near the left edge of the browser window, just above the text. Clicking on it should launch a Geogebra graphing calculator in the right margin. Kathy's college algebra textbook includes an <url href="https://yoshiwarabooks.org/mfg/appendix-c.html">appendix</url> giving some instructions for using the app.
