She did graduate work at UCLA and earned an MA in mathematics in 1977. She left UCLA in 1979 to join the faculty at Pierce College, where she taught for 33 years, retiring in 2013.   In the 1998<ndash/>1999 academic year she taught at Barnsley College in Yorkshire, England on a Fulbright teaching exchange.  In 1996 she received the Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics from the Southern California Section of the MAA. In November 2003, she won the Teaching Excellence Award for the Western Region from the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC). She is married to Bruce Yoshiwara and benefits from his expertise in all things mathematical.
