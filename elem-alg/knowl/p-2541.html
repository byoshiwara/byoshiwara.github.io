<p>Use complete sentences to answer the questions.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Explain the difference between \(-3^2\) and \((-3)^2\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If \(s^2=17\text{,}\) then \(s\) is called a <span class="fillin" role="img" aria-label="6-character blank" style="width: 2.727272727272727em;"></span> of 17.</li>
<li>If \(s^3=17\text{,}\) then \(s\) is called a <span class="fillin" role="img" aria-label="6-character blank" style="width: 2.727272727272727em;"></span> of 17.</li>
<li>What is the difference between the square of 4 and the square root of 4?</li>
<li>What is the difference between \(x^2=9\) and \(x=\sqrt{9}\text{?}\)</li>
<li>What is the difference between \(-\sqrt{25}\) and \(\sqrt{-25}\text{?}\)</li>
<li>Explain the difference between a coefficient and an exponent. Use the expressions \(2x^3\) and \(3x^2\) to illustrate your explanation.</li>
<li>Is the statement \(\sqrt{81}=\sqrt{9}=3\) correct? Explain why or why not.</li>
<li>When asked to state the Pythagorean theorem, a classmate says, "\(a^2+b^2=c^2\) when the sides of a triangle are \(a, b,\) and \(c\text{.}\)" Another student claims that the formula does not work for all triangles. Do you agree with either student?  What necessary part or parts of the theorem are not mentioned by either of the two classmates?</li>
<li>A classmate says that \(\sqrt[3]{2}\) must be a rational number because it can be written as \(\dfrac{\sqrt[3]{2}{1}\text{.}\) Do you agree or disagree? Explain.</li>
<li>Give an example of a negative irrational number.</li>
<li>What do you get if you square \(\sqrt[3]{5}\) and then multiply the result by \(\sqrt[3]{5}\text{?}\) Explain how to get the correct answer without using a calculator.</li>
<li>What do volume and surface area measure? What are the units of each?</li>
<li>How can you tell from its decimal form whether a number is rational or irrational?</li>
<li>What are the four terms in the product \((a+b)(c+d)\text{?}\)</li>
