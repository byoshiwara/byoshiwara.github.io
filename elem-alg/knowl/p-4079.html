<p>You decide to take \(\dfrac{2}{3}\) of the remaining cake home, and give the rest to your math teacher. You cut the remaining cake into thirds, as shown in figure (b). How much of the original cake are you taking home?  Your share is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\dfrac{2}{3}~~\text{of}~~\dfrac{4}{5}~~~~~\text{or}~~~~~ \dfrac{2}{3} \times \dfrac{4}{5}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If you look at figure (b), you can see that you are taking home 8 pieces of cake, and that the original cake would have had 15 pieces of the same size. This means that your share is \(\dfrac{8}{15}\) of the original cake.</p>
