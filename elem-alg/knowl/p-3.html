<p>We have included a number of features to encourage student participation. We want students to learn how to read a math book, so we have included Reading Questions that mirror the content of the lesson.  For example, the first Reading Question is "A numerical quantity that changes over time or in different situations is called a \(\underline{\hspace{2.727272727272727em}}\text{.}\)" Ideally, students would answer these questions before class, perhaps through an on-line homework system.  Each section ends with a Skills Warm-Up (with answers) for students to complete on their own. The Skills Warm-Up problems review an arithmetic or algebraic technique needed for the Lesson that follows.</p>
