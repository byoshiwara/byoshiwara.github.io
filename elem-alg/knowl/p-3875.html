<p>Newsday magazine surveyed 400 people on the question “Do you think the government is spending too much on defense?” They reported the following results: Of the college-educated respondents, 72% answered yes, and 48% of those without a college education answered yes. Suppose you would like to know how many of the 400 people surveyed answered yes. You will need to know how many of the 400 have a college education. Let \(x\) represent this unknown value. Write and simplify expressions in terms of  for each of the following.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>How many of the people surveyed do not have a college education?</li>
<li>How many of the college-educated respondents answered yes?</li>
<li>How many of those without a college education answered yes?</li>
<li>How many people total answered yes?</li>
