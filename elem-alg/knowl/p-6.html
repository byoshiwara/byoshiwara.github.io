<p>The content of the text follows our "guiding principles:"</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Develop the concepts and skills of algebra in context. Use applications to motivate and illustrate techniques. Don't frontload with "theory" or general principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep reading sections short and keep terminology to a minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>A solid understanding of basic algebra is more important than facility with complicated algorithms and procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Include graphing from the beginning. The ability to read and analyze graphs is just as important as mastering algebraic skills. Emphasize the connection between equations and their graphs.</p></li>
<li><p>Present material by increasing levels of sophistication, not by taxonomy. In other words, don't have one chapter on simplifying expressions, and then a separate chapter on solving all kinds of equations, and so on. Instead, develop algebraic skills (writing expressions, solving equations, modeling) simultaneously and incrementally.</p></li>
<li><p>Review arithmetic skills "just-in-time" as needed (and often).</p></li>
<li><p>Some more advanced topics can be left for later courses, e.g. factoring sums of cubes.</p></li>
