<p>Envirotech is marketing a new line of microwave clothes dryers. It cost them $45,000 to produce the first 100 dryers. When they had produced 180 dryers, their total cost was up to $61,000. They would like to know the total cost, \(C\text{,}\) of producing \(x\) dryers.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
