<p>Suppose you have debts of $9, and assets of $6. (Your "assets" are your possessions.) What is your net worth?  We can model this situation by the sum</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
-9+(+6)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where debts are represented by negative numbers and assets by positive numbers. If you use your $6 to pay off part of your debt, you will still owe $3, so your net worth is \(-$3\text{.}\) It makes sense that if your debts are greater than your assets, your net worth is negative.</p>
