<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Write a quadratic equation for Rick's revenue, \(R\text{,}\) in terms of his fee, \(p\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Graph your equation for \(R\text{.}\)</li>
<li>What should Rick charge if he wants to make $300 revenue? How many clients will he attract?</li>
<li>Use your graph to find the fee Rick should charge in order to earn the largest possible revenue. How many clients will he attract at that fee?</li>
