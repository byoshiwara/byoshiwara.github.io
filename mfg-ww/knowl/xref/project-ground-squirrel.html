<div class="para">The Columbian ground squirrel eats forb, a type of flowering weed, and grass. One gram of forb provides <span class="process-math">\(2.44\)</span> kilocalories, and one gram of grass provides <span class="process-math">\(2.26\)</span> kilocalories. For survival, the squirrel needs at least <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> kilocalories per day. However, the squirrel can digest no more than <span class="process-math">\(314\)</span> wet grams of food daily. Each dry gram of forb becomes <span class="process-math">\(2.67\)</span> wet grams in the squirrel’s stomach, and each dry gram of grass becomes <span class="process-math">\(1.64\)</span> wet grams.</div>
<div class="para">In addition, the squirrel has at most <span class="process-math">\(342\)</span> minutes available for grazing each day. It takes the squirrel <span class="process-math">\(2.05\)</span> minutes to eat one gram of forb and <span class="process-math">\(5.21\)</span> minutes to eat one gram of grass.</div>
