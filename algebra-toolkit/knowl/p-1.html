<p>This "Algebra Toolkit" accompanies the textbook "Modeling, Functions, and Graphs." The book itself includes a fairly thorough review of elementary algebra in an appendix "Algebra Skills Refresher," which can support a co-requisite review course or be assigned as additional practice as needed.  However, we find that a brief review targeted specifically at new material is often more effective than rehashing a previous course.</p>
