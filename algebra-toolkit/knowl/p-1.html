<p>This "Toolkit" accompanies "Intermediate Algebra." College students who take a developmental algebra course arrive with different levels of preparation, especially now that many institutions allow only a single math course below college level. The Toolkit provides students with a resource to support their knowledge of prerequisite skills. It can be used as a reference by individual students, or the instructor can use it as a supplement to the main text. We find that a brief review of half-forgotten skills, targeted specifically at new material, is often more effective than rehashing a previous course.</p>
